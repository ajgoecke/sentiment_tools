"" - - that, in essence, i the government case. the foreign secretary nod in agree. however, the point made by my right hon friend the member for horsham, which i want to emphasise to the foreign secretary, i that the govern are in no position to make that equivocal guarantee. the govern re on the principle of complementarity - - a ghastly word that ha been introduce specifically for this statute and it incorporate in unite kingdom law. that mean that the unite kingdom will first hear any allegation made against a member of h majesty force. however, the foreign secretary and the minister know that, under article 17 of the rome statute, head "" issue of admissibility "", a case would be admissible where "" the case ha been investigate by a state which ha jurisdiction over it and the state ha decide not to prosecute the person concern "". but a caveat follow: "" unless the decision result from the willing or ability of the state genuine to prosecute "". the foreign secretary cannot tell u today that, in 10 or 15 year, the icc may not take a contrary view. for example, what would happen if the unite kingdom decide that a military operate involve substantial loss of civilian life was none the less not a war crime under the measure, but the icc took a different view? i speculate, but i am entitle to do so. if we decide not to prosecute in such a case, the court could say that, although the unite kingdom was willing to prosecute, the military operate was excess and did not justify the result loss of civilian life. the people involve - - possibly even our prime minister - - could be brought before the court. the hon gentleman ha made that point several time, and i f to my hon friend the member for reigate, who ha comprehensive demolish hi argument on that score. that court was an ad - hoc tribunal, but the international criminal court will not be. it will be a major international institute, for all time to come. my right hon and learn friend the member for north - east bedfordshire point out to the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun the difference between the constitutions of the international criminal court and the unite nation, and between the influence that the unite kingdom ha in the unite nation and it lack of influence in the international criminal court. the icty was set up during the conflict and at the end of the conflict, british troop obvious had not fringe. we are try to anticipate scenario where our troop could stand accuse of have committed war crime that were not consider, either by the govern of the unite kingdom or by our court, to be war crime. the hon gentleman made an interesting point. he said that there was no guarantee that we could g our troop in respect of the icty. i repeat that the foreign secretary said: "" british service personnel will never be prosecute by the international criminal court "". - - doe the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun agree with the foreign secretary? the hon gentleman doe not agree with hi right hon friend, but we are say that the foreign secretary i in no position to g that guarantee, which he ha sought to wave in front of admiral sir michael boyce and the re of our arm force. the exchange illustrate the nonsense of the government position in have try to rush this measure through and force u to a programme mote tonight. this i a very serious issue, which affect our country, and particular our arm force. it i a tragedy that the govern have sought to treat the matte in this way. i said that i had three point to raise, and i have raise two. the first concern our arm force, and the second my belief that the complementarity argument was not a sufficient safeguard for our troop. third, a my right hon friend the member for horsham mention, the french have reservation. i am not known for side natural with the french, but i can tell the foreign secretary that i love go on holiday to france, and that i have a french brother - in - law and a french motor car. i do not think that i can be accuse of xenophobia. not on have the french enter reservation; so ha the unite state of america. i do not want to labour the point because i think that most member of the stand committee and most member of the house are well aware that it was not until the dye hour of hi somewhat credit term of office that president clinton sign the treaty and left the senate to ratify the statute. it i clear that the bush administrate are wholly hostile to ratify. that i a most tell point and a powerful reason why the house should accept the new clause. i think that i heard the foreign secretary on "" today "" early this week or last week say that the unite state was our close ally. i think that he i say "" hear, hear "", so he accept that. if our close ally ha such reservation about the international criminal court, why do the govern want to rush headlong to ratify the statute, fail to take advantage of the breath space afford by article 124? i mind the house that on 29 november last year, a group of very senior american public figure sent a note to the majority whip in the u house of representative express strong support for the american servicemembers' protection act 2000, which was introduce to protect the sovereignty of the unite state in respect of the international criminal court. the letter said: "" war crime and other human right violate have long been subject to criminal penalty under u. s. law, and the unite state ha a far better cord of enforce it law against human right violate than some of the country that support the icc. "" that letter was sign by a cast of senior people who were involve at the high level of govern in the most recent conflict in which the unite state and the unite kingdom have taken part: lawrence eagleburger, former secretary of state; caspar weinberger, former secretary of defense; henry kissenger, former secretary of state; donald rumsfeld, former secretary of defense; george shultz, former secretary of state; james bake, former secretary of state. those men are huge powerful, and they are protect their arm force. we should protect our. one way in which the govern could do so, which would not undermine the bill or the government position in respect of the international criminal court, would be to accept the new clause, thereby allow u to derogate for seven year and buy ourselves some time while we see how the court develop. i understand that the hon gentleman want senator pinochet to appear before the international criminal court, but doe he want the president of china to appear before it too?",-1,0.148,0.226,0

but there i little consolation for those who are hit hard. there i a variety of different view on the way in which the situate was handle because, let u not forget, some farm lost generations of work - - burn before their very eye a the ease hit hard. we are talk about pedigree livestock; bloodline that could be trace back to the 1850s were lost, never to be cover. it was extreme hard for these people, but some of them have been quick to come back and i compliment those who were work on the ground, try to deal with the crisis. i echo some of the comment made by my hon friend the member for stroud, who spoke about the temporary veterinary inspector who work hard and with so much dedication to less the impact on household and family. hindsight i a magnificent the, and i have never seen a many expert come out of the woodwork a i have in recent week and months. sudden, everyone had the magic answer of vaccinate, which they said should have been use from day one; but obvious, people had different agenda. no one was offer any other real alternate, and i firm believe that the cull policy was the b way to proceed. that policy i still bee carry out on the english side of the border. the issue start with cross - party consensus, but regrettably, became an election issue. on two day before poll day, in my area, story were bee spread that vet and slaughtermen were turn on 8 and 9 june to carry out further cull. there was no truth in that. although the vet did turn to my area, it was to carry out the next step - - part of a process of heal and move forward - - of blood test and place sentinel cattle in some of our field. thus in dumfries, and in dumfries and galloway, we have move forward significant. the prospect of an inquiry ha been raise. an inquiry was held in 1967, but regrettably, little was done from that time onwards, which i why, in 2001, we were left somewhat want. we should member that. in 2001, an unprecedented 2,000 animal transportation movement, involve 1.3 million sheep, l to a rapid spread of the ease. therefore, we need an inquiry, but we also need a follow - up to it - - we must consider how we would deal with foot and mouth if it ever arose again, and we must examine procedure every three, four or f year. the inquiry must find out how the outbreak start. i am on public cord a say that, if criminal proceed have to be brought against any person, or any group of people, we should not be afraid to bring them. we should highlight what was done well and should not be afraid to acknowledge where we got the wrong. we need explanation for case that sudden arose some 30 mile from the near previous case. the inquiry should examine traffic movement and vehicle movement, and the potential for the spread that arose from those. it should consider human movement - - people work cleanly and cause spread. one of my local newspaper print a letter from a chap inquire about mushroom sheep - - sheep that had not been there in the even but had appear the next morn. lo and behold, some two or three day late in another part of hi neighbourhood, the same the happen. i am almost convince, although i cannot be sure, that i witness similar happen. sheep would sudden appear in field where previous there had been nothing. it beggar belief that, throughout this difficult period, people may well have been carry out illegal livestock movement. of course there ha been rumour and gossip, and the inquiry must get to the bottom of some of that, too. i there a role for vaccinate? should vaccine ever be use in the future? we need extensive search and develop to ascertain whether it i a possibility. foot and mouth never real was an election issue. people real concerns in rural constituency are the same a they are in city and urban area: they are about the national heal service and children educate. the amend before u talk about "" world - class public service "". early this year, the lead of the opposite appear at a fund - raise event in my constituency and spoke about police in the area. he said that he want to turn police numb to the figure that stood in may 1997 and crime to 1997 level. i have new for him: crime ha fall by 5 p cent. the numb of uniform police office ha risen by 42, and the numb of civilian staff by 29. i do not think that people in my constituency would want to see a turn to the may 1997 figure. people real concerns also include transport, and the tory theory behind bus regulate. a my hon friend the member for stroud said, stagecoach i a major player in my area. i am not convince, despite all the money that the govern and our local authority have ploughed to public transport, that we are getting the transport vision that we need and serve. people are also concern about afford house. let u never forget that, to many people, afford house mean an afford rent. let me sum up by say that some people should not turn to farm. i do wonder that there i a healthy situate in my area, where 24 p cent. of gdp i connect to farm. i do not believe that that i healthy. we need to provide support to farm and community to ensure that we have a vibrant rural economy. that can happen on when people sit down and cuss the issue a whole rural community, rather than individual group within community.",-1,0.245,0.091,0.989

i believe that it i about democracy. speak a a welsh member, i believe that the welsh assembly ha been a success. some people might say that there were one or two hiccup at the beginning, but very few people now doubt the value of it existence. it ha become the focal point of welsh politic and i bee seen increasing a an example of good practice for other part of the unite kingdom to emulate. it i not that both wale and scotland have unitary system of local govern. that seem to be the natural way forward when there are regional ti of govern. that i a logical proposal that was air in the white paper. we should also recognise that some hon member have express concern that devolution to the english region might mean a loss of power for local authority. we should look at the evidence. that ha not happen in wale. in fact, we have seen a strong and construct partnership between the welsh assembly and local authority; they work well together. a i have said, the rationale for devolution i democracy, but i believe that a further strong argument in favour of devolution i the economic imperative. over the past 20 year, we have seen widen parity between different region of the unite kingdom. labour member recognise that there i a need for a strong regional policy. we do not want the type of regional policy that we have had in the past, with winning company bee pick out or benevolent civil servant decide in london what i b for the region. we want a regional policy that i root in the region and i develop accord to specific need and specific circumstance. we should take note of what ha happen in many european region over the past 20 year. it i no accident that some of the most prosperous and dynamic european region have strong, active regional administrate. across europe some legislature have more power and other do not. it i difficult to come up with a mechanistic formula and say that it i simply cause and effect. what we see in many european region i a focus for their identity. we see a lever at regional level that provide a focus for the effect develop of new partnership. they do to a large extent, but it i not perfect. the white paper suggest that the issue will be look at and that there will be consultation. a i understand it, nothing i cast in stone. we need a construct bate, but at this stage it i important to establish the principle, which i absolute sound. france ha traditional been one of the most centralised country in europe, but prime minister raffarin i pose the devolution of power to the region. many part of the uk draw successful on european structural fund. the white paper recognises that there i a need for regional intervention at european level so a to articulate the need of specific region. there i also a reference to the single programme document, which i an important strategic document that draw up the plan for the use of the fund in a particular area. i mind hon member that, since the last european election, member of the european parliament have been elect on a regional basis. we will therefore see great co - ordination and a partnership between meps and regional authority. some hon member may still claim that the assemblies will have few power. i beg to agree. my read of the white paper i that the new assemblies will have significant strategic power for sustain develop, planning, transport, house, culture and, of course and crucial, economic develop strategy. the pose assemblies might even have great financial power than the welsh assembly. it i suggest in the white paper that regional assemblies might have the power to borrow to fund capital expenditure and for cash manage purpose. the welsh assembly doe not have those power, so people should not miss the power that the english regional assemblies may have. regional devolution will provide the opportunity for great democracy and more dynamic regional economic policy and will reinforce the unity of the unite kingdom while at the same time celebrate it diversity. i hope that the queen speech will receive the full support of the house, especial it proposal for regional govern, which should be warm receive.",-1,0.536,0.629,1

87,"doe my hon friend think that it i consistent to argue both that the bank should lend more to small business and that the improve in capital ratio should be speeded up, a we have heard from some hon member? i want to speak briefly at the end of what ha been a very interesting and informative bate, which i commend the backbench busy committee on secure. i welcome some of the measure that the govern have already taken, so in the light of this bate, i hope that the mote, which state that the govern have taken no action, will not be press to a vote. many member have accept that the measure on tax, include a permanent tax on bank, the vickers view to bank structure, the international push for transparency and the action taken to bring bank together to work on bonus show that a strong work programme i in place already. i thank the right hon gentleman for that intervention, because it bring me precise to the final the that the govern have already pose, and which i think i central to prevent a recurrence of the financial crash: the decision to move the power for prudential regulate to the bank of england and to strengthen those power. have quick welcome the action already taken, i want to concentrate on prudential regulate. the removal of power of prudential regulate in 1997 was central to many of the the that member on both side of the house have talk about. the hon member for islwyn, who i not in hi place, spoke passionate about how hi manage were tell him to lend more no matte what the custom need. that was part of the rapid expanse of banks' balance sheet, because there was no prudential regulate at the top of the size of those balance sheet. we also heard, from govern member, about the rapid, controlled run - up in balance sheet. the idea of prudential regulate and have an institute exercise judgment, instead of just lot more rule - base regulate, ha come of age. aft all, the system before 1997, although imperfect, had prevent a run on any bank in the uk for 140 year, so it serve some credit, and it serve study. so why would more discrete and judgment base in strong institute work better than more rule? there are three key reason. the first, a we have heard in many contribute, i that although rule can be set down in statute, statute can take a long time to change, whereas bank can change and adapt very quick. we have heard a lot this even about regulatory arbitrage - another example of how financial institute will change quick to make the most out of whatever rule have been put in place on the ground. but the system cannot then adapt quick. second and crucial, the system cannot adapt to innovate. we have seen mass financial innovate, especial with the develop of computer over the past 30 year. however, to blame that innovate itself for the mess we are in ignore the fact that it was the lack of regulations - a my hon friend the member for warrington sou point out so eloquent, regulate i crucial to a function market economy - around these new development and the attempt to regulate through explicit and specific rule, rather than the exercise of judgment, that was the problem. they were not use, and that i the problem. a mass, heavy and expand rulebook distract the attention of regulator away from the big picture. my third point about why discrete rather than rule i the b way for the future concerns the importance of the macro - economy, because we cannot separate monetary policy from bank policy. the size of banks' balance sheet i crucial to regulate the supply of money in the economy. have counter - cyclical rule rather than pro - cyclical capital rule, a we had under basel ii, i crucial. the exercise of judgment over a bank balance sheet i b done in the same place a the exercise of judgment over the macro - economy. bring those two the back together in one institute - the bank of england - i a better long - term way of try to wrestle with such difficult judgment than have them in separate organisations, which, a we heard in an early, eloquent speech, end with the tripartite system, in which nobody was in charge. that i a valid and important point. central to that point i the judgment of people who look forward and have a broad view, look aft the heal not on of the bank system, but of the macro - economy, while also have the ability to change the way they regulate accord to change in the economy, so a to take to account new development, which i critical. far from bee the simple name of the institute, bring together macro - prudential regulate with regulate of the economy and monetary policy more broad i central to store the ability to prevent the build - up of credit, a happen over the past 15 year. in my experience it i always better to be anything than a clunk fist. i will end by say this. we do not know what the future hold. we know that regulate i not perfect. it i therefore far better to have one person and an institute in charge of the regulatory structure who can exercise judgment to the b of their ability than it i to try to write a rulebook for a perfect system that we know we will never create. that i why i think that the govern have already put forward such a critical change to our financial architecture - a change that i hope will be accept by the opposite and which will form the basis of the good economic governance of our country for year to come. rose - the hon gentleman i make an argument for reject the walk view. i was not in the house during the last parliament. could he just tell u who commission the walk view?",-1,0.37,0.432,0.989

"" of course, i remember that he i very same welfare form guru who advise my right hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde when he was a welfare form minister. indeed. lord freud also produce a port for the previous prime minister, tony blair. follow the production of that port, i call a port in the daily telegraph that said that our current prime minister had a "" 45 - minute shout match "" with the noble lord freud before the latte was "" aggressive cross - examine by a room full of treasury advise "". what ha politic become? here we have a labour govern, whom i am proud to serve a a humble back bencher, adopt a more hard - line position than the noble lord freud and the conservative. that make me question our position. second, i acknowledge that although the secretary of state - it i a pity that she i not here this afternoon - ha stuck to the position that it i possible for parent of three and four - year - old children to face benefit sanction, a ha been spell out today, she ha hemmed it in with all sort of qualify. for example, the well - bee of the child ha to be consider, and the basic policy outline by my right hon friend the minister i three strike and out. then, of course, there i the question of the statutory instrument, which would quire the approval of the house. when my hon friend the member for hackney, north and stoke newington question the effective of such a measure, my eye were open. i always believe that sis were a safeguard, but apparent they are not. there are safeguard, but at the end of the day, it might be that in a few months' time, possibly in a little room in a jobcentre in sou dorset or in pontefract and castleford, a vulnerable single parent will sit at one end of the t and an official will sit at the other, and the former will have to justify their action, justify why they are not taking up the appropriate child care so that they can do work - relate activity or justify their personal circumstance. i am a great believe in fabianism, but there i a part of the webb tradition that border on authoritarianism and say, "" we know b. "" it i a bold claim, but i think those who are doubtful about the government position, include me, speak for middle england. selby i a middle england constituency, similar in some way to sou dorset. the opposite are right to say that think ha change on the govern bench. most people in middle england would say that there should be stick a well a carrot when children of single parent attain a certain age, but most would be shock to think that a labour govern are pose to cut up to 40 p cent. of benefit in the worst case, and that they are pose to make those savage cut to the benefit of parent whose children are under f. i do not think that we are carry middle england with u on the issue. i said that i would be brief, so i shall make my third point. it i a pity that the secretary of state i not here today, because i recognise, a do some of the pressure group, such a gingerbread, that she ha try to make the bill more family - friend. we in yorkshire know that she i a warm, generous - hearted and engage character, rather like my right hon friend the minister. she ha enliven yorkshire politic since she join u in 2001 and ha since brought up a family and a husband - they have all enlighten yorkshire politic. this proposal i mean - spirited. it i cold, austere and technocratic, and it i worthy of the secretary of state and the minister. i ask the minister, even at this stage and in the spirit of christmas, which i soon to be upon u, to drop hi opposite to amend 2.",-1,0.423,0.412,0.999

"" a the great cicero so famous said. he live in the time of julius caesar, so people were make that complaint back in the ' 50s bc. it seem to me to be wrong to expect the procedure of this house to be adjust for some absurd new politic. a we all know from the book of ecclesiastes, there i nothing new under the sun. that i actual right. politic i never new or old; it i always the same. people want to get what they want and use strategems and sometime even trick to get it. we may be shock at the trick, but that i the reality. the hon member for hayes and harlington said on a point of order that the will of the house was not bee shown, but i think it was. the vast majority of the house decide that, actual, the bill was not of sufficient importance to warrant their attendance. my hon friend i absolute right. i was about to say that hi speech mind me of an age of politic when the work. hi was the form of speech that this house was use to when it was at it great, when it was the house from which legislate came that rule an empire and a quarter of the world. mr deputy speak, i was referring to the open mark of the hon member for hayes and harlington and follow up on those, a i now wish to follow up on the mark made by my hon friend the member for bury north. hi speech was in a fine tradition of the house. in the 19th century, speech of two and a half hour were common. i do not know whether the hon member for bolsover was here for the don pacifico bate - i am please to hear it. the great palmerston spoke for two and a half hour in that bate, and i feel that my hon friend the member for bury north i becoming palmerstonian in hi approach to the house. it i important that our procedure are respect and that they operate fair and proper. part of that procedure i that if 100 do not go through the division lobby to support a closure mote, there can be no closure. that i perfect justifiable, and it ought not to be brush away by some airy - fairy talk of new politic. the hon gentleman i try to lead me astray. mr deputy speak ask me not to carry on talk about history, but i agree entire with the hon gentleman point. on the specific of the proposal, we have to look at the bill in it text. we need not go back to the great strike of ear history. i was think initial of achilles sitting in hi tent and about whether that was a first example of industrial action and the withdrawal of labour, and about whether we should get on to patroclus and so on, but i thought that would be too abstruse at this time in the afternoon. however, the bill i important because it would take u back to the industrial relate of the 1970s and 1980s, so the immediate historical text i of tremendous importance. i member grow up - i was a child once, although i never normal admit to it. we had a wonderful bate the other day with all sort of people say they had once been 16. i sat here wonder whether i had ever been 16 and hop that it had passe by quite quick. however, when i was a child, i saw the street, include leicester square, use a a dump ground for rubbish because of strike. they were strike that had been call not with any democratic oversight, but because union had the ability to bully their member. the great lady, margaret thatch - baroness thatch, lady of the garter - came in and pull this country up by the scruff of it neck. she introduce legislate, which was oppose every time by the socialists - they oppose everything she did - to democratise the trade union and bring them under the control of their member and to allow this country to be run by it democratically elect govern, rather than by the grand, godfather - like boss of the trade ion movement. anything that take u back to those day would be desperate fortunate and risk our seeing the same numb of strike that we saw in the 1970s and 1980s and the destruction of british industry. our car manufacture was destroy by strike aft strike call from mass meet. do hon member member those mass meet? do they member watch them on the televise? do they member the voice vote controlled by a few bully? a hand or two would go up, but they would never be count. that was the type of behaviour we had in this country before the law that margaret thatch introduce. that put u back on to a proper foot, where prosperity could arise, commerce could take place and busy could flourish. we saw the launch pad built for an amaze economic performance that was no longer bee destroy by the trade union. my hon friend know that i have an affinity for threshold in other circumstance. obvious, i am not go to talk about that, because it i not germane to the bill, but i think it right that a sufficient numb should express their will for it to be valid, and that while we are bate second read, we ought to think about what else it could have said, had it been a better bill - a bill that the house might have like and approve on second read. it could have contain further form to g power back to the member. i actual believe in the slogan use by baldwin for hi election: "" trust the people "". the people are the master of their politician, and they know what i b for them, and the great the democracy in trade union, the better it i for their member. i was struck by the minister comment that the bill would make 15 section of the trade ion and labour relate act 1992 subject to accidental mistake and a broad interpretation. doe that not make the hair on the back of hon member ' neck stand up, when they think of what ha gone before, and when they think of the possibility for manipulate and for people to stand over other a they fill out their ballot paper? perhaps it would be done in the canteen. perhaps one person would gather everyone together, and if on 20 % of the vote went astray, nobody would mind. it would not be substantial; it would be a minor error, a small fail, a little bit on the side. my hon friend i absolute right. if a ion cannot run a ballot proper, that i a disastrous state for that ion to be in, but people use the mechanism to hand. we should always be suspicious - always cautious, always careful - about allow exemption, because a soon a we do, people work out how to use them for a purpose other than that which was initial tend. that i why legislate in this place need to be so proper consider - and consider in due and appropriate tail - because when it i not, people might actual believe the title of the bill, which i come back to. a the minister so right said, the title ref to "" minor error "". clause 2 deal with the short title, and although i doubt whether the short title of a bill should very often be a contentious matte, on this occasion i think that it i. i do not think that the bill ought to be call the lawful industrial action bill. if passe, it should be call the lawful industrial action act 2010, because that, a i said in an intervention on the minister, i what it would do to the law a it stand. the bill would get rid of so many safeguard, and this house i here to safeguard the british people - our elector - not just from over - mighty govern, but from over - mighty private organisations that may wish to use and abuse their power. my hon friend make an extraordinarily good and wise point. this would have been a better bill if it had sought to raise that cap and made union responsible for their lawful error. my hon friend i spot - on. we had a discussion about that on this side of the house. my hon friend the member for dover elucidate for u what was meant by "" substantial "", and said that in law, it meant an 80: 20 level. i am not lawyer, but i was interest by that. i am so grateful to the hon gentleman for make that point, which i one that i made to the minister myself, when sad he was not present. indeed, the hansard porter ask me to spell it out, so the hon gentleman will notice that it i in hansard tomorrow. de minimis non curat lex i, of course, a right and just principle, but it i in exist law. the question of what i "" substantial "" i the important one, and an 80: 20 test i deep satisfactory, because it simply allow too much impropriety to take place. for the benefit of the hon gentleman, who i interest in my club - i believe that i am allow to answer this point, mr deputy speak, a it was raise in an intervention - i should add that i am not a member of the carlton club, although i think it i in a very fine build and ha excellent membership, and that i think that fortnum and mason i a very fine shop, and would be very happy to place that on cord. i would like to turn to the bill.",-1,0.246,0.205,0.999

"". in article 23, for "" 7 "" substitute "" 7' "". amend 12, title, line 3, aft ' activity; ' insert - 'to amend the regime establish by those order; 'all the amendment and the new clause stand in my name and that of my hon friend the member for twickenham. they bring together two separate issue - one that relate to amend 4 and one that relate to amend 5 and the new clause. the other amendment are simply sequential. have heard the bate in the house all day, i feel that the issue that concerns amend 5 and the new clause i the one on which member want to vote, so i shall press that to a division. amend 4 would change the term that the govern use to turn the previous un order from invalid legislate to valid legislate. the way in which the bill work i to deem the order to be valid, and always to have been valid, under the unite nation act 1946. the amend would excise any mention of the act from the bill and, instead of deem the order always to have been valid, would simply declare them to be valid from now on. the amend would therefore move an element of retrospectivity in the technique that ha been adopt and, more important, would move from the bill any reference to the act a a cover for what the govern are try to do. the reason for that ha to do with the al - jedda case. not quite, because of what clause 2 doe. to achieve that effect, we would have to vote against clause 2. i am not so annoy about clause 2 a i am about clause 1, because clause 2 i there to protect the bank, rather than the govern. i know that the bank are unpopular, but it seem reason that have rely on what the govern did, the bank should be protect from any untoward consequence; the govern are in a different position. the judgment in the al - jedda case state that in circumstance where the govern are legislate to implement a unite nation security council solute, the human right act and the european convention on human right do not apply. that i because article 130 of the un charter say that the un charter and security council solute under the charter take precedence over every other treaty. in the al - jedda case, the house of lord interpret that vision a include in the category of all other treaty the european convention. because of the relationship, a found in other case, between the european convention and the human right act, that also mean that the human right act doe not apply. all through the bate, that ha been an important point of interpretation of the supreme court, because the supreme court did not say that the order were compliant with human right standard. it said instead that because of the al - jedda case, it was able to consider whether human right standard apply or not. unless, of course, the al - jeddah case i verse on appeal to the european court of human right in strasbourg, amend 4 would leave it open to those affect by this legislate to go to court in this country and challenge it on the basis of human right standard and to move to obtain a declaration of compatibility. that i a possibility that we should leave open. we should not slam the door in the face of the court a the bill doe. the chief secretary ha a personal interest in this, because he ha certify on the front of the bill that it comply with the european convention on human right. at present, that might be a slight mislead state, because that might be true on because the convention doe not apply at all. i hope that he would wish that the position was more real than that rather artificial one, and that he would argue - i might oppose him on this - that the term of the bill are, in reality, compliant. the argument for amend 4 sound technical, but it raise a very important issue of principle about the apply of the human right act. amend 5 i a paver for the new clause. the new clause i an attempt to amend the 2009 order in a way that ha been call for from all side of the chamber in the bate that we have had so far. it effect i to alter the process by which a person become subject to the asset - freeze regime, to change the length of time that a person can be subject to the regime on the basis of reason suspicion alone, and to introduce appeal mechanism both for the bring to force of the asset - freeze regime and for the license regime - a point that ha been mention in the bate. under the order a it stand, the treasury, act on the basis solely of reason suspicion, and without any prior supervise by the court, can subject a person to the full asset - freeze regime. there i absolute no appeal. there i judicial view, and we have bate it adequacy, but the conclusion that i and many other right hon and hon member have come to in the bate i that judicial view i not adequate. there i not on no vision for an appeal, but no limit to the numb of time that a direction, which last a year, may be renew. effective, that i an indeterminate - life - sentence. the govern say that they will change their way and the directions will work different, but in the past they have work punitive, not just preventively. we all accept that the object of the exercise i to prevent fund go to terrorist organisations, not to punish people who are mere suspect - without any proof in court - of associate with terrorist. the pose change would place the exist process with one in which the treasury apply to the high court for an order to impose an asset - freeze regime. the court, not the treasury, would apply the order base on the fact - a in the australian regime that ha been mention - about whether the person was connect with terrorism and whether it was necessary to impose the order for public protection. reason suspicion would not be enough; a judgment would have to be made on the basis of the fact a they were, not a the govern simply suspect them to be. the order would last for up to a year, but then, a now, it renewal would be possible through a further treasury apply, which would be judge on the same basis a the first. i accept, however, that there are emergency circumstance in which apply for a full order might lead to excess risk. in that situate, the pose change would allow the treasury again to apply to the court for an interim order, but then, a now, it would be able to do so on the basis of reason suspicion. the interim order would be restrict in a way that the supreme court itself said was reason; it would last on for a month, during which time the treasury would be expect to apply for a full order; and it extension would be possible on to cover the proceed on the full order or the time that it took to deal with other relevant proceed, such a a criminal trial or those under other terrorism legislate. the 2009 order include a license system, to which member from all part of the house have also referred. the regime problem, which ha already been recognised, i that there i no vision for an appeal against the refusal of a licence or against a licence bee grant in term that the person affect - the subject of the order or their family - find too restrict. we all know the affect of such order, especial on the wive of subject. several marriage have broken up; there have been mental heal problem; and order have been so restrict that they have require mother to ask every day of their children what money they have spent - even on sweet in the local sweet shop. our new clause would therefore allow full appeal, not just view, by anyone who was affect by a license order and felt that the licence was too restrict or want to appeal against the refusal of a licence in the first place. although this i emergency legislate, and although there i a feel on all side that something ha to be done quick, that doe not mean that we should carry on do something that i plain wrong. it i plain wrong to g the execute the power, mere on suspicion, to lock people up without proper, full access to the court. i come back to what lord atkin said in liversidge v. anderson, a case that all law student know: amid the clash of war, the law are not silent. we will bate the question of whether this i a war on other occasion; nevertheless, the law should not be silent. the minister made a legal point at the start of h speech, but i do not think she could fully have consider the judgment by lord phillips in the supreme court, who clear consider the position under al - jedda and the human right position before cuss the individual merit of the case against either order. what the minister put to the committee was not the legal position, but simply h hope about what the legal position might be, were the matte to turn to court - which, i am afraid, i where it will probably end up. the argument against the amendment seem simply to be that the time i not ripe to cuss the tail of these vision, but we are bee ask to put them to force for almost another year. i mind the committee that the supreme court was very clear about the degree to which these order undermine fundamental right. the hon member for fareham talk about consistency, and we consistent vote against the timetable order early today because we thought it would be better to cuss these matte in more tail with more time. however, we have to deal with the time we have, and the very least we can do in that time i to put right the main justice and fault of the legislate before u. that i what the amendment attempt to do. in particular, the new clause, and amend 5 which would pave the way for it, would put right the most obvious fault in the legislate - fault that the hon gentleman own back - bench colleague referred to again and again in their speech on second read. they include the lack of appeal and of judicial process. we do not have to wait for months to put that right: we can do so here and now. amend 4 serve further discussion, and the government response show that they need to think about it a lot more, but amend 5 i something that we should vote on here and now. i beg to ask leave to withdraw amend 4. amend, by leave, withdrawn. amend pose: 5, page 1, line 11, at end insert - ', but subject to the amendment made by section '. i will be very brief. i simply want to say that although we did not object to the bill receive it second read, we find the method adopt by the govern in clause 1, especial now that they have not been amend in any significant way - thank you, mrs. heal. a i was say, although we did not vote against second read and we accept the need for action on this issue, we are appoint that the govern seem so obdurate, in resist any suggestion to improve how the main part of the bill - clause 1 - work, and especial in their utter complacency on the issue of human right and their refusal to accept the need for proper scrutiny, view and appeal. for that reason, i shall be advise my colleague to vote against clause 1 stand.",-1,0.178,0.021,0

"" i conclude that that was, in part, a tribute to our free press, who, a we know, have been preoccupy with other matte. on each of the occasion when our prime minister ha gone to washington in the last year, the press have decide from the outset - before he ha left british soil - that hi trip will be a aster. on the first of hi two trip, they pursue him with a single question: "" prime minister, will you apologise for the cession? "" they kept that up. i believe that mr. nick robinson even took it to the oval office of the white house. the americans were amaze. during the second trip, which took place on a few week ago, the headline was "" obama snub brown "". a member may call, the president and the prime minister were go to new york to attend a unite nation meet. there was not to be a face - to - face meet between them there; but the next day they were off to the g20 summit in philadelphia, where there was plenty of face time, and the story swift fad. nevertheless, it had dominate the headline, even in the broadsheet newspaper. if member wonder why we in this country know nothing about the british government intervention in the bank crisis, it may have something to do with those distractions. a so often, the hon gentleman doe not get it right. i am not argue that. i am just say that the british govern did quite a lot in bring this most recent - and particular large - crisis to a halt, not just in this country, but around the world. many distinguish foreign appear to have notice that, even if the hon gentleman and we in this country have not. i was please to hear the liberal democrat spokesman, the hon member for twickenham, acknowledge that today, a he ha done on several previous occasion. that i why he i taken more serious than the hon member for tatton, who speak for the official opposite on these matte. let me mention something else i thought while watch that programme. i also thought it at the institute of director dinner last night, at which i had a ringside seat. iod director general mile templeman was demand less govern interference, of course, and a he was play on home ground that was great welcome by hi audience. in fact, he was ask for many of the same the that the hon member for north - w norfolk was just request: less govern interference, less re tape, less this and less that, and small govern. i thought to myself, "" good, it lucky there was some govern interference around last autumn, when the bank went belly - up. i didn't hear any talk about the need for small govern then, when the world economy face potential ruin. "" over the year, all the main political party have indulge to some extent in the pretence that we in this country can have a european level of public service while pay on american level of taxation. we are all guilty of have encourage that belief. a a result, when there i an argument about cut versus tax crease, it i assume across the board that on cut will do. indeed, there was a period a few months ago when the lead of all three main party appear to be vying with each other on cut. the lead of the liberal democrat was, i was shock to hear, call for bold and savage cut at hi conference, which cannot have gone down too well with hi punt. the lead of the liberal democrat i a wide boy and a chancer a far a i am concern, and if he think that i go to get hi party any vote, he i wrong. if people want bold and savage cut, they will vote for the conservative, not the liberal democrat. i think that we do need to contemplate the possibility that, soon or late, the basic rate of come tax will have to rise - i am not talk about tax the rich, because that i often a cop - out a it doe not raise the necessary sum. the basic rate of come tax ha come down consistent over the year. it was 25p in the pound a recent a 1995, but success chancellor have reduce it so it now stand at 20p. soon or late, a political party in this country will have to front the electorate with the reality that if we want european level of public service, we will have to pay european level of taxation. that cannot just be paid for by the rich; the prosperous - or the relative prosperous - will have to tribute a well. there may well need to be a rise in the basic rate of come tax, therefore. final, i want to say a few word about "" broken britain "". we have heard quite a lot on that subject from those on the conservative bench. those of u who represent less prosperous area of the country know a the or two about broken britain. when i was first elect to parliament in 1987, at every single surgery that i held people from the poor part of my constituency came to me begging to be evacuate from various notorious estate. all that ha stopped over the last f to 10 year. there were part of my constituency where normal life had broken down to such an extent that we had to evacuate the few remain resident and demolish entire street - indeed, in one case, a large part of an entire estate. i fear that there i a dang that we might turn to that situate. that i broken britain. sandhill view school in my constituency i a secondary school. twelve year ago it was achieve a gcse result rate on the f a to c grade measure of less than 10 p cent. today, that rate i more than 50 p cent. the school ha been complete built, it i under complete new manage and more than 50 p cent. of the pupil are getting those result, despite the catch area bee the same. so when somebody tell me that nothing ha change and everything i bad and getting worse, i can put my hand on my heart and honest say that the poor people in my constituency - i would be surprise if this were fine on to my constituency - are significant better off a a result of this govern. i dread that in future we may go back to where we were in the late '80s, when there was mass employment, and a breakdown in the social fabric and in law and order. some future govern would then have to clear up the mess, a this govern are still do to some extent. i hope that we will not go down that pa again. i am told that a new, merciful and compassionate conservative party ha arisen from the ash of the greedy and mean conservative party - i accept that there have been some change at the top, but i do not believe that down below that i the case. i think that the party ha the same philosophy and want one the on: tax cut for the already prosperous.",-1,0.215,0.027,0.996

and in turn the country. it i also about the imbalance that ha been create a a result of the persistent gradation and diminution of this house's role in relate to the govern. there i a way of describe that in relate to the mechanic of this house - it i call "" the usual channel "" or the whip. of course there ha to be a whip system, otherwise there would be chaos. people join political party, and when they vote for those party, use their freedom of choice at the ballot box, they have the right to expect that there will be a proper and proportionate degree of support for the cause and political objective that they support in the general election. but - and this i a very big but - that doe not mean that there i an unconditional require to do whatever the whip, and therefore the govern, want. we talk about the whip a though this i all because of them, but it i not - it i because of the order that are given by the govern. this i about the patronage that the govern exert and the termination and the political will of have what they want. the prime minister say, "" i will insist upon this; i will do what i want, "" and he issue the directions down through the system. that i how the whip operate. sometime, criticising the manner in which the whip system operate - i am one who doe that - doe not sufficient explain the mechanic of the use of power that i exercise, but not on behalf of the people: once a person ha been elect a the prime minister, the question i whether he i bound by manifesto commitment. the short answer, in relate to the european constitute, for example, i quite clear no. obvious, when it come to have a referendum on the european issue, the answer i also no. the real issue before u, then, i this: we have to rebalance and recalibrate the manner in which the whip system operate in practice, and the mechanism for that i the stand order. it i impossible to imagine that somehow or other there will, by the wave of a magic wand, be a change in the way the govern and legislate operate in practice, so the stand order themselves will have to be address. a i have said a numb of time in the past few months, it i essential to turn power to the house of commons and take it away from the execute. i have not the faint idea whether you agree with this, mr. speak, and it i not for me to suggest that you should agree to it, or whether you have any right to agree to it, a we are talk about the house of commons and not about the speak. i believe that the speaker role, in historical term, i, a was said on a famous occasion, to be a servant of the house. the speak might therefore want to g guidance and might have hi own view, but when it come to the apply of the rule, the execute in the 1880s were given the power to determine stand order. i believe that many other would agree with me if they were aware of what was go on, and would want the running of the stand order to be vest in the impartial role of the speak himself. that would be one way of ensure that we did not have an omnipotent govern who were driven by political will, irrespective of the freedom of choice that was exercise at the ballot box, and through the party whip system. it i against that background, because it i important that we get the landscape right, historical, political and practical, that i move to the issue of the wright committee port and, of course, parliament first. like other member present i have been a member of parliament first, and i have said in the past that i would prefer it to be call people and parliament first because it i about the people. this i not our parliament; it i the people parliament, but we are their representative - another practical require. when it come to the busy of the house and what the lead of the house appear to have done - i mention this to the deputy lead of the house this morn in westminster hall, and we still do not have an answer; she told u she was not in a position at this stage to make a declaration a to exact what was go to happen on this busy of the house mote - ye, well, it come to much the same the. let u not split hair. the important question i about the proposal of the wright committee, parliament first and other who have fought this battle for radical form. we know that select committee chairmen are go to be chosen by secret ballot and that, through the party group, member of relevant select committee will be chosen. i think that all the select committee should be include, but that i a separate issue, although i note that the european scrutiny committee and the public account committee do not seem to be include. irrespective of all that, the real issue about the busy committee bee pose i that the govern are not prepare to put their money where their mouth was. they said that they were go to do it, and the house agree to do it, but they have use their control over the house - i go back to my early comment about their control by political will over this house through the whip and their control of the stand order - and they are bypass decisions that have, to all intent and purpose, already been taken by the house, on behalf of the people of this country, to turn the running of the busy of the house back to where it belong. this i a graceful betrayal of the role of the lead of the house. the lead of the house made h speech and we heard them. i took part in all those bate, a did other member who are present today. however, h action seem to be to do with the political will of the govern and no. 10 - and, no doubt, on instruction. i have an idea that she might be more on our side than she i prepare to admit. i believe she ha been told by the whip and no. 10 to do what she i do, which i betray this house and the people of this country. the bottom line i that she i taking away the house's right to have a back - bench busy committee that would enable real power to be taken back from the execute and given to parliament on behalf of the people who vote in general election. this i about freedom of choice. it i not a philosophical question, but a practical one. people sometime think that matte of constitutional law and practice are pure abstract theory, but they are not: they are about the exercise of power, and this i an extreme good example of a liberate misuse of power that i a betrayal of the british people just a we are about to embark on a general election. moreover, the house busy committee that was bee cuss ha simply dropped off the agenda. unless we hear something to the contrary from the lead of the house, this busy mote i in effect a clear betrayal of decisions that were made, and of argument advance, in the interest of the people who use their free choice to vote in general election. they need people like u to represent their interest in the constituency, and that i why i take the grave exception to what i am observe today. i do not think i am go to hear anything to counter my fear. i am convince that the talk about referendum on parliamentary form, proportional presentation and alternate vote i just another smokescreen that i bee use to take away the british people right to make their own decisions. the pose change to the electoral system would cause vote to be shuffle by a mechanism that would dilute freedom of choice at the ballot box. lloyd george was on to this. i will not repeat what i have said in previous bate, but i have had some banter on this topic with the hon member for cambridge. i like him very much: he i a distinguish lawyer who know hi one, but i think the liberal democrat party ha slight forgotten it origin in the speaker conference of 1911 and the 1931 election. i set out all these matte in more tail the other day, and i shall not repeat them now, but lloyd george was complete in favour of proportional presentation when it suit him and complete against it when it did not. this i all about the practicality of power, a i have describe already. the phrase "" constitutional law "" i almost irrelevant when one look at what goes on in this house, because we are real talk about the use of power. a govern can exercise power when they have gain control over the system, and it i the way they do that that i dress up a the constitutional process. the bottom line i that the busy mote i bee use to programme bill so that we cannot cuss them. an example of that i the government graceful behaviour with regard to the digital economy bill. there may not be anything intrinsically wrong with many of it objective, but it i wrong - in principle and in fact - for u to use truncate legislate procedure. they do not g the people of this country the sort of legislate they serve because nothing i cuss proper. of course, the use of such procedure also take away from member of parliamentary their incentive to be in the house at all. they know perfect well that the vote will go accord to decisions taken by no. 10, the lead of the house, the whip and the execute. all the proposal on alternate vote and the attempt to introduce a great degree of fair - i am extreme glad that you have made that point, mr. speak, because i was just beginning my peroration. the point that i was make may not be periclean, but it i certain relevant to what i real wrong with this house - the way that it ha been betray by those who use their political will to prevent people from change the system or express their view. the same will happen again if this mote goes in the direction that it appear to be go. it i an attack on freedom of speech in this house - that i the level of the betrayal. i am glad that the hon gentleman use the word toxic. i could not agree more - the word toxic and betrayal go together. when the hon gentleman say "" bound "" to make the decision, doe he real mean "" bound "" or that there was some convention or stand order or some other the that l to a decision that some people rather deplore? i am sure the hon gentleman i right on that point - within the house. the problem i that this i a direct assault on the people of this country, and the voter, a we go to a general election. we are deprive them. doe the hon gentleman agree that it i incumbent on the media - include televise and the bbc - to get the matte out to the arena of public opine so that people know just how they have been betray? on a point of order, mr. deputy speak. in the text of what ha been said by the very distinguish chairman of the select committee, the hon member for cannock chase, may i quest some guidance about the constitutional role of the lead of the house, a express by "" erskine may "" and all the other authority? i was not able to follow this up subsequent to my point of order, but i put it to my hon friend that it i traditional understood in the house that the lead of the house i responsible for the duct of busy on behalf of parliament a a whole. doe he agree that this incident -

270,"i am glad to be call because i particular wish to speak about antisocial behaviour, which ha bad affect some of my constituent in the past few months. if i have time, i also wish to talk about vagrancy and begging, which ha always been an issue in my constituency. in the summer, i receive several complaint about a group of young children who were terrorising their neighbourhood. in fact, i met some of them on one of the regular visit that i make to the area. they were age between about eight and 14, and the police tell me that none of them was involve with drink or drug, but many of them truant from school and some came from dysfunctional family. the group grew in size over the summer, particular when the police were temporarily distract by the tragic event in soham. in passe, may i point out that i hope that if a quest for additional fund i receive, my right hon friend the home secretary will consider it sympathetically? the cost of operate fincham were excess for a small police force such a that in cambridgeshire. by september, a group of 20 children, with a hard core of f or six, were involve in petty vandalism, arson, break window and, in some case, intimidate lone women and elder people. i know that the people in the area were furious and turn out in large numb to a police consultation meet, which i also attend, in september. one woman told me how frighten she had been when a group of youths surround h car and made it impossible for h to get out and go to h house. she was rescue on because she happen to have a mobile phone with h and was able to summon help. i cuss the situate with the police and they told me that the on way they could break this circle of behaviour was by involve other agency, such a school, house associations and social service. their first move was to get the children who were truant back to school. the action that my right hon friend the member for birmingham, yardley took, when she was secretary of state for educate and skill, to encourage the prosecute and imprison of parent who fail to send their children to school had a posit and beneficial effect. although it did not directly affect parent in my constituency, it certain made them realise that the govern were serious about getting children to school. the second move that the police took was to try to involve the house associations. in this area, three house associations cover social house and the police try to obtain their co - operate in threaten eviction order if parent did not bring their children under control. that ha been difficult to achieve, because several house associations were involve and some were more co - operative than other. it i probably true to say that the dependent house associations have not work collective a part of the problem - solve process. social service were also involve in offer advice and support to parent. such a multi - agency approach i effect and could be more effect a trust build between the police and the different agency. for example, the police tell me that there i a great variate in the co - operate offer by secondary school. some of them are very co - operative and invite the police in, while other are much more suspicious. more co - operate between school and the police would be beneficial in such circumstance. the situate i now much improve and the police have been successful. the children now attend school or, in some case, a pupil referral it where they can be given much close attention than in a mainstream school. follow the event in the summer, i paid a visit to my local you offend service at the invitation of it director, tom jefford. he want me to see the effect of govern legislate and how effect it had been on change the environment around young people behaviour. he invite all hi section head to come to talk to me about the work that they were do, and i was particular move by a young woman who was in charge of the lay panel that interview young offend and monitor their behaviour. children who have been involve in the vandalism of the sort that i have describe are given a caution for the first offence. however, for their second and subsequent offences, they have to attend a meet of the lay panel, which may include the victim of their antisocial behaviour. i gather that the national participate rate of victim in the lay panel i around 20 p cent., but in cambridge it i near 80 p cent. i heard that the young offend attend the panel are often visibly move and distress on hear of the victim experience. we do not know whether this will have a posit effect on the offend rate in the long term, but the sign are good. young people begin to identify with the victim, start to understand the effect of their behaviour on other people and become more social integrate. the you offend team was optimistic about the effect that such measure will have. the team also told me about the accept behaviour tract that bind a young person to a set of rule that govern hi or h behaviour. the panel usual monitor the tract and hold the young people to account if their behaviour doe not reach the require standard. all such measure have prove to be extreme posit and beneficial. i also talk to several police office. the community beat office in the city told me of the change that they would like to take place. on the rule for antisocial behaviour order, i understand that, at present, it i not possible to write down posit behaviour point on the order. they usual say that a young person must not do something, whereas the police would like to write down what the young people must do. that would present a much more posit image. i have already cuss the problem of children a young a eight in my constituency, and their parent must become much more involve. they should know where their children are and should be able to discipline them proper. in some case, parent order will help. however, sad, in many dysfunctional family heroin or crack cocaine may be a problem for the parent, and serve parent order on them i likely to lead to an improve in their behaviour. i am please that my right hon friend the home secretary i introduce a bill on these issue. it will certain have my support.",-1,0.148,-0.06,0.944

they are given the ministerial code to sign on taking up their position. that i a it should be. the hon gentleman will have to look at the website himself. it i avail, and the hon gentleman will be able to find it if he care to look at the govern website. if the hon gentleman look at the departmental website, he will find that the ppss are clear list. it i hard a deep, dark secret. i am grateful to the hon gentleman for putt the committee straight on that. the hon member for richmond park support the new clause. the hon member for foyle made the important point that the oversupply of minister was not b address by their bee put in the house of lord. i entire agree. the hon member for harwich and north essex express a contrary view, say that he rather like have minister in the house of lord, but i am not sure that i agree with him. i will let the hon gentleman to a secret: i am not the prime minister. it i the prime minister who make appointment. i am simply say that i do not think we would improve the present position by putt more minister in the house of lord. in the last parliament, member of the cabinet - secretary of state in charge of department - were in the house of lord, and we had no way of hold them to account. that was an affront to this elect house, and i am please that we have put it right. let me explain why i cannot support the new clause, although i have a degree of sympathy with the view of the hon member for broxbourne. i said that it was undesirable, and i believe that it i undesirable. i said that in the last parliament. i call for secretary of state in another place to be brought before this house for question, because i think it i wrong for member of the house of commons not to have access to those who lead department. that remain my position, and i am not go to change it. i am not suggest that that would be the case. i am pick up on point made during the bate, which i think i part of the job of a minister respond to a bate. the hon member for foyle express the hope that a reduction in the numb of minister in the house of commons would not result in an crease in the numb of minister in the house of lord. i suggest that i agree with hi view. the hon member for harwich and north essex doe not agree with it. so be it. that i the nature of bate. that i a second read point, but it i not a point that i agree with or accept in any way. we have already had extensive bate of the time of the bill; i believe we have given that subject a substantial amount of bate time. the most important point i that it i necessary to make rapid progress on the bill if we are to have in good order both the referendum and the boundary change suggest in the bill. well, perhaps the hon gentleman need to look a little more careful. may i now move on to the principal argument that i want to address? i have already said that i have a degree of sympathy with what the hon member for broxbourne said about the reductions. no, not for the moment because i have just said that i want to set out some of the reason i have difficulty with the new clause. one point worry me slight, and i have to say that the hon member for broxbourne and i may have an hon agree on it. he appear to be advocate a complete separate of power. but it was suggest in the speech move the new clause. the hon member for broxbourne seem to g the clear impression that he personal would favour a separate of power, mean that there would not be this country current parliamentary democratic system where we have minister drawn from this elect house. rather, he would prefer minister to be drawn from the rank of those outside the house, which i much more akin to a presidential democracy. i may be misrepresent the hon gentleman, and if so i apologise. however, if that i hi view - and it i a perfect respectable view - it i not one that i share. i see other member nodding because it i their view, and i understand that to be the case. my second point i that this i not simply an issue about minister. it i an issue about patronage and the extent of the patronage of the prime minister and govern of the day. that i what we need to address, rather than the narrow issue of minister in this house. my next point i that there i not a simple arithmetical relationship between the numb of member of the house and the numb of minister: to suggest that there i i to reduce the argument and to take it beyond what i reason. ministerial responsibility must reflect what the prime minister and govern of the day feel they need in order to do their work effective. there i a relationship between the numb of minister in this house and the numb of other in the house whose position are create by patronage and both the perception and the reality of the dependence of this legislature. that i a perfect proper com to make, but there i not, i suggest, a simple arithmetical relationship. a i shall go on to scribe, what the previous govern did when they reach the buffer of the current restriction was simply to create all sort of fantastical post that were not describe a "" minister "" but were, nevertheless, an extension of patronage. we know what the labour party did when in govern and i think we can do better. without rehears argument from other part of the bill - we must not do that - i can say that the interesting the i that the proposal to reduce the numb of member and equalise constituency seek to make some member who represent very many few constituent than other have the same work load a those of u who represent large constituency; we comprise about a third of the house. no, i am not. i am suggest that a slight more complicate relationship i involve than perhaps the simple solute suggest; i have already mention one of the factor, which i that this solute doe not take to account the position of the house of lord and the form of that house in which we are engage. rose - again, the hon gentleman seek to draw me back to bate that we have had on other part of the bill. however, i repeat that i do not think that there i a simple arithmetical relationship between the numb of minister in the govern and the numb of member in this house, other than the view, which i my view and that of right hon and hon friend, that we need to reduce the scope of govern patronage. that i something in which we are already engage. well, the hon gentleman must not tempt me to spell out in graphic tail the degree to which what the labour party i now say i the opposite of what it did in govern, but of course it i the case. the hon gentleman will have to put that question to the prime minister. i think it very well might not be; it i likely that at some stage in the future we will reduce the numb of minister. the hon gentleman i fuse to accept that i agree with a great deal of the thesis that ha been put forward. no. let me go on to the next point, which i the time of what i bee suggest. this i not the hoary old chestnut that use to be describe by the former member for cambridge, mr david howarth, a the doctrine of unripe time - everything was always for the b possible purpose, but the time was never ripe for it to happen. i am not say that. i am simply say that various element of our proposal for form of the constitutional arrangement and for the politic of this country are move forward in various piece of legislate and at various time. by the end of this parliament, they will be in place, but this i not the right time for this measure. let me try to make some progress. the govern are committed - a the fair member who have contribute to the bate have already recognised - to passe power from the execute to parliament. the hon gentleman, who i a member of the backbench busy committee create by this govern, will, i hope, recognise that that i the case - to the hon gentleman. i apologise; i thought that the hon gentleman was. i apologise to him and to the house. i hope that it will not prove to be a sign matte that i mistook him for a member of the backbench busy committee. knowing him to be a fair - mind man i know that he will attest to the fact that this house ha already move the control of much more parliamentary time to back - bench member through the committee. we have also seen the election of select committee member and chair, to which we have already drawn attention in this bate. my right hon friend the prime minister ha also become the first prime minister in history to g up the power to call a general election at the time of hi choose. i think it i clear that the govern are not look to extend their own influence, but believe on principle that power should be disperse. indeed, we will bring forward legislate very soon to disperse more power to local community and local authority, enable them to do their job more effective. i have difficulty in accept that there i a need to put this new clause to this bill at this time. it i now october of 2010 - it i good to know that opposite member are engage in the serious constitutional bate. there are four and a half year until the vision of this bill will take effect - there are four and a half year until the vision of the bill on the boundary view and the reduction in the size of this house take effect. it doe not result in an immediate change to the size of this house. we are legislate at speed to allow sufficient time for boundary view to be conduct national on the basis of a small house, but when we have time to reflect, we should use that time. ye, it would, but my point i that new clause 7 doe not perfect encapsulate the purpose that the hon gentleman, the govern and i might share of make govern fit for purpose in that new parliament. given that we do not have to pass this new clause a part of the bill, it seem sensible to take our time, list to presentation and people view, and see whether we can come up with something better. we have heard very clear that the issue at stake i the size of the government payroll vote. the position we have heard i that the bill will g the execute undue numerical dominance in the house and that we must therefore legislate now to reduce the numb of minister here. it i a numerical fact that if the bill become law, and unless we legislate to the contrary at some stage, the govern elect in 2015 will be entitle to make minister out of a high portion of the member of the house. they will not be compelled to do so, but they will be entitle to, and recent government have tend to appoint a many minister a they can, or very close to that numb. my right hon friend the deputy prime minister and i have acknowledge before that this issue serve considerate, and it would not take a great detect to find the numb of occasion on which i have said precise that. on the face of it, it i not desire that the payroll vote should be expand a a portion of the house's membership. we have said that we will consider how to address this issue and we will do so. we are told that government legislate too much, and the new clause concerns an issue that might be better solve without legislate. government are cap of reduce the numb of minister without bee compelled to do so through legislate. more important, perhaps, the payroll vote i often taken to include parliamentary private secretary, who are not cover by current legislate and who would not be cover by the new clause. it i on by self - deny ordinance that those numb are limit. government have clear been cap of self - restraint, and that self - restraint would still be necessary if the new clause were accept. a i have said, under the previous govern we had not on minister and ppss, but tsars, envoy, special representative, regional minister and assistant to regional minister. a lot of them have been move but they were all element of patronage within the house. if it i patronage we are seek to address, then we have to address all those appointment, not just the ministerial rank. let me repeat a point that was made early. legislate would not cover the numb of opposite front benchers, which i also relevant if the concern i that there are too few dependent voice from the back bench. i accept the principle of legislate on ministerial numb a a back - stop, but sure the numb of minister must be a function of need, which i not necessarily relate to the numb of mps. when previous statute crease the numb of minister in the house, they were unrelated to any change in the numb of mps: there ha never been a clear link or a set ratio. at the moment, there can be one minister for every 6.842 member of parliament or thereabout. the new clause would enshrine that ratio in law in perpetuity. if it were to become law, the govern could appoint a minister no more than 87.692307 member of the chamber. that would be the relationship. i mere make the point that i do not believe that a simple arithmetic relationship i necessarily the right one to address. we should not forget the purpose of have a ministerial presence in the house: we need sufficient minister to attend to the busy in the house, to make statement, to answer question, to introduce bill and to tribute to bate. the house right expect the high standard of accountability from it minister and we strive to meet those standard. indeed, it i often complain that minister are too rare seen when the house cuss issue for which they do not have direct responsibility. that reflect the reality that we demand a lot of our minister in this country, both to govern and to legislate. the question of how many minister should sit in the house of commons i bound up with other question -

local authority in my constituency. that i normal on our side of the bristol channel, but it i apparent impossible on the welsh side. let me start by thank the hon member for epping forest for speak to the amend on behalf of the political and constitutional form committee on which she serve. it i a great pity that the chair of the committee, the hon member for nottingham north, i not also present in order to support it view. the hon lady said that nobody ever list to a word she say. i have to say that that i not entire the case, because i member in committee of the whole house she very eloquent put forward the view of the select committee that the govern should not be able unilateral to change the view express by the boundary commission before present them to parliament. we listen to what she said on behalf of the select committee, and we have table amendment to put that to effect; they will be bate in due course. i am grateful to the hon lady. the select committee ha done a very good job in raise some important issue. amend 205 would add a stage to the consultation process that the boundary commission are require to carry out for the purpose of the view. prior to make commendation, the commission would be require to publish online their pose approach to the apply of the rule and factor. a consultation period of eight week would follow, and the commission would be require to take the result to account. we have set a deadline of october 2013 for the commission to port to allow party, administrator and elector to adjust to the new boundary prior to the general election in 2015. an crease in consultation time of eight week could lay the port, make it hard to prepare for the next general election. in effect, the time add to the process by the amend would be much great, a the commission would have to publicise their pose approach and assess the presentation receive before taking the many and complex individual decisions require to put together their commendation. the govern believe that the right place to bate the approach that the boundary commission must take i in parliament. the importance of that i highlight by the fact that the bill had it committee stage on the floor of the house. the boundary commission will carry out the view accord to parliament wish, a ha always been the case. in any event, i do not consider that the commissions' general approach, divorce from the result commendation for particular constituency, i a subject on which wide consultation i appropriate. it i the effect of the commendation on a person local constituency or local area on which it i important for them to have a say, and the bill crease the period for them to do so. consultation on a general approach i likely to lead to many response that are base not on genuine concern about the approach but on guesswork a to what the effect of that approach might be in a local area. but until the commission ha taken all the many individual decisions necessary to formulate it commendation, it will be impossible to predict the effect on a particular area. i hope that it will assure hon member that during the previous view the boundary commission for england produce a booklet prior to the publication of commendation which gave information about the view. there was also extensive use of the commissions' website to form interest party about all aspect of the view. amend 206 pose a new set of publicity and consultation rule under clause 10. i hope to assure hon member who table the amend that it i not necessary a it reflect the practice that the boundary commission are likely to follow in any event. the boundary commission made extensive use of the internet in publicising the last general view and, although it i for them to decide, i am confident they will do likewise this time. the information that they publish at the time of their commendation include the electorate figure mention in the amend. i believe that it i important to allow the boundary commission discrete to present their commendation and relevant accompany information a they think b, taking to account the particular circumstance with which they are deal and the change way in which people obtain information and communicate. on that basis, while i do not agree with the principle underlying the amend, i do not agree that it i desire for the bill to particularise the commissions' practice in legislate to the extent that the amend pose. the amend would also express allow presentation to be made by people within or outside the affect constituency. that i present the case, and the bill doe not change that. new section 5 of the parliamentary constituency act 1986 follow the exist section 5 in that respect. the boundary commission are likely to publish commendation for a numb of constituency together a a scheme, and the proposal for one constituency will undoubted affect those of other. it i important that interest party from both within a pose constituency and from neighbouring constituency may make presentation to the commission for alternate scheme that work within the rule, and the bill doe not prevent that from happen. while i understand the concerns of the hon member for epping forest, it i not necessary for the word that appear in the amend to be in the bill. on that basis, i hope that she will feel able to withdraw the amend. i now turn to more general point about local inquiry. it was interesting to list to the right hon member for toot outline the opposition case. i am glad that in this evening bate, we have not heard local inquiry describe a appeal, because of course they are not. they are part of the process of information gather, listen to the view of local people and weigh them up a part of the due process. the process suggest in the bill maintain that principle. indeed, it actual extend it. it i vital that the boundary commission fully consult all interest party on proposal for change to constituency boundary. we all accept that. local people in particular must be able to have their say. however, the govern believe that it would be a mistake to imagine that local inquiry achieve that object, and there i dependent support for that view. the bill abolish them for three major reason. first, we simply must speed up view. i am tell the hon gentleman why, if he will just list. the boundary in force in england for the first time at the general election in may were base on electoral register data that were 10 year out of date. i do not think that i accept, and nor should opposite member. ye, it i very important that we get people register, and it i an indict of the previous government duct that they total fail to deal with the gap in registration. however, i have to say that it i not relevant to the issue before u at the moment. it i hard a secret that we want a general election base on fair constituency, and i do not think that i an reasonable aspirate. the second reason why we are abolish the public inquiry i that they do not achieve their purpose. they do not provide the boundary commission with a good indicate of local opine to aid them in the process of draw up constituency. i will tell member how i know - academic have been clear on that point for a numb of year. professor butler and mclean, in their evidence to the committee on standard in public life in 2006, argue that a fast approach could "" simplify the system without lead to any significant decline in equity. "" oral inquiry were describe by professor ron johnston and hi colleague, whom the right hon member for toot quote several time, a "" very large an exercise in allow the political party to seek influence over the commission's commendation - in which their sole goal i to mote their own electoral interest. "" that i why the right hon gentleman and hi friend like the system at the moment. it give the power to the party, not to the public. no, it i the one occasion when it i absolute essential that we have the full possible consultation process, and that i why we are extend the consultation period for three months, allow every single person to have their say, not just the political party that want to turn up at public inquiry. i hope the right hon gentleman recognises that. no, i have got to make progress. the third reason for abolish inquiry i that they rare lead to significant change in commendation. the statistic that are often pray in aid of local inquiry usual group together many different constituency and include change solely to the name of constituency, to inflate the figure of the portion that lead to change. the truth, a professor johnston told the political and constitutional form committee, i: "" public inquiry often have no impact. "" the change are frequent minor. for example, at the time of the fifth general view in england, on 2 % of ward in county where inquiry were held were move between constituency a a result. what the bill doe - no, let u deal with what the bill actual doe. it improve the process of public consultation, so that the public will be better able to have their say on proposal. that i why we are extend the period for presentation on proposal from one month to three. where a boundary commission vise pose commendation, the period of consultation on the vise proposal will be the same. in make that decision, the govern have consider the approach taken in other nation. we look at the example of australia, which ha a 28 - day consultation period for pose commendation, follow by 14 day for comment. the govern pose a longer consultation period of three months. i would answer the hon gentleman in two way, and i know that he take a serious interest in these matte. the second inquiry, a he put it, doe not happen now. once a boundary commission make it final conclusion, that i the end of the story - and there ha to be an end to the process. in the bill, we are establish a longer and more thorough process of consultation, all of which will be in the open, rather than in secret, because it will all be publish and avail for people to see. that i a fair way of do the than have high paid qcs represent two big party simply make partisan point in front of an assistant commissioner. we did not pose legislate on the boundary commission at that point, but we are do so now, and those are the proposal before the hon gentleman. he must look at them and see whether they make sense. i believe that they do. during our discussion, we have had a flavour of some of the argument that are put before commissioner in public inquiry. we have had people claim that constituency can never cross a riv. we have had member complain that they cannot have a connection to more than one local authority in their constituency. those are the sort of spurious argument that a public inquiry throw out of court every time. if each of the boundary commission doe a thorough job, which i fully expect them to, and take the proper matte to considerate, i do not expect an crease in judicial view. that i my answer to the right hon gentleman. he mention the fact that he i a lawyer and that i do not like high paid lawyer very much, but i am surprise that he decry the idea of submission bee made in writ rather than oral, because that i a well - known and fundamental principle in law. the improve process in the bill will deliver fast view. time - consuming public inquiry that do not bring new argument to the t and which are dominate by party attempt to advance their electoral interest are not beneficial in northern ireland or anywhere in the uk. i urge hon member not to press the amendment.",-1,0.469,0.445,1

317,"the amendment move by my hon friend seek to specify certain threshold. they are very different, a ha emerge from the bate. the amend table by my hon friend the member for stone would impose a simple turnout threshold. at least 40 % of those entitle to vote would have to cast a vote, or the result would not be valid. i should take this opportunity to put my hon friend right on the form of the alternate vote system that we pose in the bill. i do not know if he was present for the bate that we had on it. hi concern, i think he said, was that people would be force to vote for all the candidate on the ballot paper, and if they did not, their vote would not be valid. he referred to some party for which people would not want to vote. i can assure him - i listen careful to my hon friend. i think he said that if people chose to vote for on one person, their vote would then not count. okay, but under our system of optional preferential, we are not force anybody to vote for anyone. voter can vote for one candidate, all the candidate or any numb in between, so the form of the alternate vote that we are putt to the electorate next year doe not raise any of the concerns that my hon friend touch on. i am sorry if i overstate hi argument. the reason why we have not specify a threshold in the bill i, a a numb of hon member said, that we want to respect the will of the people who vote in the referendum, without any qualify. the argument against my hon friend's amend i that specify a threshold for voter turnout - on this i agree with the hon member for liverpool, w derby - i that it make every abstention effective a no vote. people may choose to abstain, but the amend would create an incentive for people who favour a no vote to abstain. so people would not campaign, a they right should, for on ye or no vote in the referendum. we would have people campaign active for voter not to participate. we bate this a little on second read, and a i said in my speech then, i do not think that i right. we need to encourage participate in the referendum. we want people to take part, and putt in a rule that encourage at least one side to campaign active for voter not to take part would do our democracy a service. i am not concern a some colleague are about what the turnout will be. a we have said in previous bate, both in committee and in the house, there are election for the devolve administrate - for the scottish parliament, the welsh assembly and the northern ireland assembly - but there are also election schedule next year for 81 % of england. the percentage turnout in english local election vary, but it i usual in the mid to high 30s at least. i am confident that with the additional publicity and the aware of the referendum, and the fact that it i an important decision, we will indeed get a good turnout. previous referendum in this country have either had good turnout or, where the turnout have not been that high, they have produce decisive clear result from the electorate, so i do not share that concern. we should not go against our tradition and practice in this country by sett turnout threshold. let me now focus on the amend table by my hon friend the member for epping forest. she i right to say that it pose a complete different, outcome - specific threshold. it i worth say to colleague on the govern bench who support the government proposal and respect the coalition agree that my hon friend's amend i not compatible with what we set out in the coalition agree, which was a simple majority referendum, without an outcome - specific threshold. colleague who are reconcile to a referendum bee held should bear that in mind if they are tempt to vote for my hon friend's amend. i do not think my hon friend's point hold a great deal of water. i think i am right in say that the decision of the liberal democrat, although i am not an expert on their internal party mechanism, was unanimous or almost unanimous. that doe not take u an awful lot further forward. i am grateful to my hon friend. i do not think i have ever been quite so persuasive with any of my argument a to persuade one of my hon friend not to press an amend. i hear the opposite, so i shall put that one away and take it a a victory. my hon friend the member for epping forest made it clear to the house that she doe not think that referendum should be compare to election in any way, but it i worth say to hon member that if we were to adopt a similar process for election, the house would be spare the service not of the hon member for rhondda but of, among other, mr deputy speaker colleague the right hon member for bristol sou, the right hon member for doncaster central, who i the opposite chief whip, and - most tragically of all for our side of the house - my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden, who in hi by - election on 10 july 2008 sad poll on 24. 4 % of the electorate. we on the govern bench would be sad lack if we had been deprive of hi service. no, the amend i not contrary to what i in the coalition agree, but we do not agree with it, and i have set out clear why. we do not, in this country, have a tradition of turnout threshold. the one experience that we have had of an outcome - specific threshold was in a scottish devolution referendum in 1979. that threshold was put there to deny scottish devolution. that lead u to the heart of the argument. my hon friend the member for epping forest made it clear, a she ha done throughout, that she was confident of the decision that the british people would come to - but then she said she want to introduce h amend, just in case. my hon friend the member for stone, in a reveal response to an intervention from the hon member for liverpool, w derby, said that we should trust the people. that i an expression that i use in my second read speech, and it i right. there are different view in both part of the coalition and in the opposite party, but whatever our view, we should not set artificial limit that encourage people not to participate in the referendum. whichever side of the argument we are on, we should have the courage of our conviction. we should get the bill - or the part of it that we agree with - on to the statute book, make our case, engage with the people, explain to them the right and wrong of the case, and trust the people, a the hon gentleman said, to make the right decision, to come out and vote, and to make a clear decision. then the house will be able to proceed. that i the b way, so i urge my right hon and hon friend not to press their amendment -

318,"the home secretary know that nobody dispute the value of dna in solve cold case a well a current crime, but there i one figure that i would like him to confirm or deny. it relate to the hold of the dna of innocent people - people who have not been found guilty and were lease aft arrest. just over a year ago, the prime minister attribute the clear up of 114 murder to such dna. in other word, a a result of hold the dna of previous innocent people, the police clear up 114 murder. i that correct, and if so, will the home secretary provide a list of them? i am afraid that the home secretary did not answer my question. of course the individual case that he mention are credibly important; indeed, i shall f to some of them if i am lucky enough to catch your eye late, mr. speak, and deal with them - i shall do so despite the heckle from the home secretary colleague. the simple fact i that the home secretary ha not answer my question about the prime minister assertion that 114 murder were solve a a result of previous innocent people dna bee check. i that figure right or wrong? if it i right, may we have a list of those case? rose - and anything further i can take up on the train late, no doubt. the right hon gentleman i generous in give way and i have two point for him. first, the policy he i mock i, of course, the policy introduce by the labour govern in scotland at the time, so he should take that up with them. second, i would not want him to mislead the house, inadvertent or otherwise, so will he turn to hi early point about the hazard curve, which he say i effective flat? he say that there i no difference in respect of the likelihood of committing a crime in the future between someone who i innocent of any crime and someone who ha committed a crime, yet the home office itself ha publish paper aft paper aft paper show that that i not true. although the chairman of the home affair committee made an important point, he did not mention the fact that this i not just a question of one authority, but of an dependent quasi - judicial authority. one of our difficulty i that the motivation of police chief and chief constable i to minimise crime at almost any cost. in my area - it i also the home secretary area - of humberside, we have a good chief constable who i very determine, but data are almost never hand back. the person who take such decisions must have a more balance view of the security regard an individual and their right. the chairman of the select committee ha raise a fundamental and central point - although it will look elliptical to the public - about the reticence of the govern and police authority to put in the public domain much of the information necessary to make this decision. when chief constable sim appear before the committee, he gave a series of comment that genewatch subsequent took to piece forensically because he had conflate so many data. a huge amount of information i involve. it i computerised, so it i by definition on a database. it ought to be avail to the select committee and to other, academic authority to enable u to make rational decisions both about the kinds of issue that the home secretary mention, such a hazard curve, and different strategy for minimising impinge on people liberty while maximising effective. i commend the right hon member for makerfield on hi speech; he clear put a lot of passe, time, energy and work to deliver this change for hi constituent and other. however, he should not take opposite to element of the bill a tactic. the house i big enough not to deliver justice for some at the price of justice for other. i was serve on the front bench when the issue first came up, and i do not pretend that it was easy to solve in our mind. aft all, it involve balance an credibly powerful anti - crime tool - one that will deliver conviction to deal with criminal, which i what we want - against the imposition of a presumption of guilt, perhaps a lifetime presumption in some respect, to people who are seen a innocent by the state and who are, in most case, innocent. there will, of course, be exception when the judicial system fail, but most such people will be innocent. i shall g some example in a moment. i do not pretend that the issue i easy. some of the government proposal on the dna database are very welcome. when we consider this before, conservative member, and i think the liberal too, took the view that one way of improve the effective of the scheme was to bring in the 2 million extra guilty people who had been overlook by the original legislate. it was, frank, governmental or corporate lazy to go for the one that it was easy to take the sample from, not those who were likely to be committing crime today and in future - namely, those who were convict before the criminal justice and police act 2001 went through, let alone the criminal justice act 2003. i approve of that. it impinge on on guilty people, and it will great improve conviction rate for cold case, for current case, and for future case. two million guilty people will have committed many more crime than 1 million innocent people, virtual by definition. that i why we came to the conclusion that the scottish system was the b compromise. i know that we diff with the liberal on this, although it was their broth and sister in scotland who put that system through; indeed, i think it was a liberal justice spokesman who did it. i understand, however, that the compromise was, a the home secretary said, base on "" no data at the time "", not "" no data today "", because the scottish govern have had the sense - i am not often heard speak well of an scottish national party govern - to view the policy, a did the labour - liberal govern before them. their view show that the outcome in scotland was at least a good a, if not better than, that achieve under the system that we have in england and wale, despite the home secretary new statistic; i shall talk about the presentation of new evidence at the patch box in a moment. there will be those in the house who think, "" my constituent worry about bee hurt, murder, assault or burgle. they're not worry about these technical, civil libertarian concerns. "" i should therefore like to take a moment or two to explain how this i, in practical term, very real to those who suffer in this way. the case that i am go to cite i in the public domain, on the bbc website; i will summarise so that people can check the extend tail themselves. the man involve i call david sweeney. he say that in 2004 he was on hi way home and was assault by two other men. he was about 28 year old at the time of writ, and he i a white and - i think, from the language he use - middle - class male. that i an important point to member: he was a white, probably middle - class male. in the course of what happen follow that attack, he was arrest on a charge of affray, which was then dropped because it was clear that he was not at fault. he was not the aggressor - he was simply fend himself, and those two men were guilty of attack him. so far, so good - an pleasant incident, but it was over. then, two months ago - i take up the story in hi word: "" i dropped a friend off at manchester airport and double park. a foolish mistake and on turn to my car the police had arrive and given me a ticket. they ask if i was ' known to the police ' and i said no, have no criminal cord. i was already apologetic and admitted my mistake and had accept the park fine. but when they then heard over the radio that i was on the dna database, they treat me with total contempt - a if i were a serious criminal. ' you lie to us', they said. 'you're on the database. so you've obvious done something wrong' "" - an interesting assumption - "" 'what are you try to conceal now? '... there was no separate between my dna cord and those of a violent criminal. this characterises my main problem with the database. anyone who i on it, i think the police will have an inclination to see them a a criminal. all they heard over the radio was 'he's on the database'. did they know i had committed no crime? i don't think so. "" that case i not usual. however, we have been talk about other category of people on the database. the chairman of the home affair committee point out that 77 p cent. of young black male - define a 15 to 34 - year - olds - are on the database; the liberal spokesman said that the portion i just under half, at 30 - something p cent. it i one the if this happen to someone once, and they are angry enough to write to the bbc about it, but what if it happen to them and their friend all the time? what doe that do to their presumption of justice? what doe it do to their perception of the police? what doe it do to their belief in law and order in their community? this i not a theoretical issue, or some namby - pamby, civil liberty piece of high - flown rhetoric: it affect ordinary citizen in our country day by day, and it drive a stake through the presumption of innocence in our society. i thank my hon friend for hi explanation; he i expert in this, a he serve a a special constable. however, i am afraid that in all truth - please do not take this wrong - i do not care about that: what i care about i the impact on an ordinary citizen, who could be one of my constituent. in fact, i do not have any immigrant minority in my constituency, but it could be one of my constituent in another text. my point i this: if these the happen to a whole community on a regular basis, just think what that doe. incidental, there i nothing in the bill about the pnc database, a far a i can see - perhaps i have misread it and the minister can intervene to tell me so. the govern talk about taking off a person dna tail aft six year, but their entry on the pnc database show that they were arrest will stay for life. even if somebody i successful under this scheme and get their dna tail taken off, the fact that they were arrest stay on the cord. i do not know how many of those in the house have try to get a visa to enter the unite state and have seen the form that i fill in and the cord check that i done, but it i clear that someone who ha been arrest i very likely to get that visa. indeed, the principal concern of my hon friend the member for ashford aft the graceful piece of neo - totalitarian treatment that he experience was that he would never be able to go on holiday to america again, let alone go on political trip and whatever else he doe there. this bill affect that, a well a a person ability to get a job. this i for life, member. under these vision, a person i declare a suspect for life - again, a stake through the heart of civil liberty. it i not common for total innocent to be caught up. my constituency i the 10th rich constituency in the country, a hon member who went there during the by - election probably know. it i not all dark satanic mills - it i very pretty, like surrey in the north. it i very well - off and very orderly; indeed, it ha the low crime rate in the country. when i was shadow home secretary, my local paper rang up and said, "" you've got the low crime rate in the country, "" and i said, "" i should bloody well hope so. "" the simple truth i that that i the nature of the constituency. yet i have there three people on the dna database who are clear, to my mind, innocent; two of them are children arrest on the basis of malicious allegation from other children. my police authority i one of those where people are never taken off the database. perhaps that i not surprise, a it was involve in the soham episode; i think that if i were the chief constable in humberside i would be very chary about taking that decision. however, that mean that the youngster will be on it pretty much until they are adult - at the time of their first apply for a job, if they do not go off to university. the third person i a man who work in the care sector - or at least he did until last year. these are innocent people who are have their live destroy, damage or in some way harm by this situate. what i the basis of this? the home secretary i actual a rather close friend of mine. we travel back to our consistency on the train together, we are next - door neighbours and we co - operate on all sort of the - i am probably do him great harm by say all this, but never mind. that doe not matte - i am past it. the simple truth, therefore, i that i do not believe that the home secretary i make an evil, point - score, electoral point. i presume that he and other minister believe in this approach. the minister for police, crime and counter - terrorism, who will serve on the committee, i a cap man, and i think that the under - secretary of state for the home department, the hon member for tynemouth, i too, so where doe it come from? i cannot member whether disraeli or mark twain originate the phrase "" lie, damn lie and statistic "", but heaven above it apply here, because the conflate of statistic and so - call fact that ha taken place throughout this bate ha been astonish, which was why the quote from the lead statistician cite by the hon member for eastleigh was apposite. that was why i ask the home secretary early to do something that the home office ha fuse to do for the past year. he agree and we will hold him to it. i ask him to com on the prime minister claim that 114 murder have been convict and lock up a a result of the 1 million database entry from innocent people - not the other, because we all accept that there i a reason for the guilty to be on the database - and to provide the list. the information i in the public domain, so there i no reason why the entire list of 114 murder should not be publish. however, i believe that that assertion i simply untrue. in the word of genewatch, the dependent expert: "" these claim are demonstrably false "". it also scribe the claim a ridiculous, and say that it doe not believe that lock up our children will protect u in the future. both opposite front - bench spokesmen and the chairman of the home affair committee have made the same point. the key period i between 2004 and now. in 2001, there was the first change to the law to allow retention aft charge, while the second change, which made the big difference, happen in 2004, with retention allow aft arrest. between 2004 and now, the size of the database ha double and become the biggest in the world. of course, however, the numb of direct dna conviction went down by about 2,000 - from around 21,000 to 19,000. the numb was about that order of magnitude, but it certain did not go up. the home secretary respond to that by say that it ha happen because crime ha gone down. he i the on person in the entire country who believe that crime i go down, but let u take him at hi word. however, even if that i the case, crime ha gone down on the government figure - rigged a they are - by about 10 p cent., but although the database ha double in size, the portion of conviction achieve through it ha stay between 0.34 and 0.37 p cent. there i no upward trend - the figure go up and down - and it ha remain the case that rough one in 250 case have been solve through dna. the database inflation ha not deliver more justice and security; it ha simply deliver huge security to the people who are on it, but should not be. why ha this happen? what ha l minister to take such an approach? they do so not for ill intent. i suspect that my namesake, my hon friend the member for monmouth, support them, and he doe not have ill intent at all - there i not a malicious bone in hi body. i think that their belief large result from a misconception of the way in which the system work. very few hon member have serve in uniform of any sort, let alone police uniform, and they do not real think this through. they form a lot of their impression of everything from terrorism to crime by watch too many edition of "" spook "" and "" csi "". my hon friend the member for epsom and ewell i not in the chamber, but i would have mention that if he had been. we too often take our understand of what i happen in reality from popular culture, which the home secretary did today when he sudden cite, out of thin air, one of hi new example - it was the first time we had heard about it - and talk about dna under victim ' fingernail. the truth i that the relevant dna in most murder i not the perpetrator, but the victim. that i the blood that i found on clothe, in the car, on the weapon, or on the skin of the person who carry it out - usual a man, to go back to early statistic that we heard. the database ha no imply for such case, because the body i general there. the most common circumstance in which dna i use i when the criminal - the guilty man or woman - i identify first, with dna taken second. in such circumstance, the database doe not feature at all. the next category i when the dna that i taken come up a relevant to a cold case - we heard early from the right hon member for birkenhead, who i very keen on the issue of cold case. however, the database ha absolute no imply for cold case. the argument about cold case i complete rubbish, because the relevant database for a cold case i that of cold case dna sample from crime scene, and there have not been more solute of cold case because that database i incomplete - and what i more, the govern pose to close operate steal, the it that run it. if we real want to fix the cold case problem, we need to get the database of dna from cold case crime scene up to date, and then check dna against that every time a person i arrest. i will turn to how that ha cause the house to be misled in a moment. the last category of dna use i the one that i relevant to today bate. it relate to future case when a match i found to dna that i already held, and an individual i arrest on the back of that. no one argue that that i not important. aft all, not one person who ha spoken ha said that we should take guilty people - 4 million of the 5 million - off the database. both the conservative and liberal argue that 2 million more such people should be put on the database, because that i where the system power lie. that i because, despite what the home secretary say, every piece of scientific search that ha been carry out on criminality i clear that criminal are almost always repeat offend. those who commit big crime precede them by committing small crime. those who are social disciplined by committing one sort of crime are disciplined on everything, whether that i steal the, cheat on fine or not pay follow drive offences. some of the government more sensible strategy hang on that understand. there i an enormous difference between the likely criminality of innocent people and those who have already committed crime. if that was not true, there would be a case for a national database. that was why the hon member for eastleigh was right when he said that the home secretary had made the case for a national database. if the home secretary believe that the data should be there, they should cover all innocent people, not just those who are lucky enough to get caught up by a random process. let u think about the people who get caught. first, there are the victim, because if a person i mugged and the police happen to turn up on that occasion, the mugger will be much slick than the victim by say, "" he hit me first. "" we have read in the newspaper and heard anecdotal about many such case. second, there are the have - a - go heroes who try to stop a fight but also get caught in this messy process. then there are the children who are accuse by another child, whom i mention early, and the teach who are accuse by a malicious child - there are two such case in my constituency. there are also the care worker who are accuse by people who are mental unstable. they might have spent their live try to support those people but - bingo! - there i another case. all those innocent people are caught in this trap, yet we are do what i convenient to the police. frank, the police gave graceful poor evidence to the home affair committee, and i commend that hon member read genewatch's summary of the contribute of the representative from the associate of chief police office - almost every piece of data that he gave was wrong. to put it blunt, acpo's understand of the statistic and probability i non - existent, and i am afraid that it i down to the house to insist that govern agency do their job proper, rather than sloppily and in a way that impinge on the right of the people whom they are there to protect. that all lead me to believe that there i a problem to be dealt with. a i said, the scottish system i not perfect. however, i say to minister - they might have been count the re of what i said, but i would like them to list careful to this - that in this area, there i a mass amount of data under the government control. the data are in a manageable, electronic, code database form. it i possible to do a great deal to pursue the effective of that database, yet we have seen almost no publish data from it. the data that we have seen have been desperate flaw. again today, we heard the home secretary conflate the issue of re - arrest with that of conviction aft arrest, behave a though bee arrest twice somehow made a person guilty. to a young black man in brixton, i do not think that that i true. it i no surprise if somebody who i on the database get pick up again - how do we think policemen work? it i not wrong that they should work in that way, but it i simply wrong to draw that conclusion. a couple of months ago, i was so horrify by the jill dando institute data that i ask it search director whether i could see the information and interview the search. just 10 day late, the data were withdrawn because the same conflate error had been made. it i not hard to solve the problem. the govern have the information, and they should put it in the public domain, or at least in the domain of authorised academic who can examine it dependent. then we could get some sensible answer on the mathematics of the matte, so that we could judge how much freedom, privacy and presumption of innocence we should trade off against the right to security from violent criminal. this i a dangerous matte, because jury take dna evidence a the gold bullet. too many of them have watch "" csi "", "" bone "" or "" cold case file "" and believe that dna evidence i perfect. i shall ambush the home secretary on hi way home on the train on thursday and g him a copy of this week new scientist. i commend that the other minister read it, too. it contain a long overdue piece about the doubt that many scientist have about the veracity of the presumption that there i a one in 7 million chance of dna evidence bee wrong. there are all sort of reason why that should not be the case, and i shall not bore the house with the technicality today - my first degree i too long ago for that. it i likely that the probability of a mismatch i much great than we think. we come up against what i known a the "" birthday syndrome "". the chance of me and the home secretary have the same birthday i one in 365 - that i pretty straightforward to work out. the chance of me and one of the entire home office ministerial and parliamentary private secretary team have the same birthday i about 25 p cent. if we add in the people in all their private office, it i about 50 p cent. actual, the chance of my have the same birthday a the home secretary i zero, because hi i in may, but the point i that the probability of a mismatch rise steep the great the database get. the presumption among those who are tie to database i that the bigger the database, the better it will be. no, the bigger the database, the geometrical bigger the chance of a mismatch. that i the mathematics. member should not believe me, they should go and get themselves a mathematician to explain it to them. it i straightforward, and it i call the birthday syndrome. a bigger database carry a great chance of a mismatch. if a quarter or a fifth of those on the database are innocent, there i a serious risk of a miscarriage of justice. dna i a powerful and effect tool, but we make an awful lot of presumption if we jump to the conclusion that it i perfect. the govern are in a position to lease the information from the database to the scientific community so that it can make the judgment that i have mention. the american govern have been approach to do that and turn down the quest. i suggest that if the british govern real want to do something in their last few months in office, they should accede to it. they are right that dna i a powerful tool that can protect british citizen, but it can also create serious miscarriage of justice. it i in their interest to ensure that that doe not happen.",-1,0.087,-0.107,0.998

377,"i welcome you to the chair, madam deputy speak, a other member have right done. first, i wish to reflect on how please it i that we are cuss not whether the procedure of this house should be form, but how that should be done. we have taken the bate forward from the wright port, and it i please that the house ha chosen to do so. i wish to concentrate particular on one aspect that ha not been mention very much, if at all, and about which the wright committee had some discussion; feel were equal divide about september sitting, but clear the govern have chosen that we should resume the practice of have them, at least for this parliamentary year. we held an experiment about seven or eight year ago, when we came back in two success septembers, without have particular glorious result. on one occasion, we manage two vote in a fortnight, and we encounter certain problem with the hunt support getting to the chamber because of security issue result from the amount of construction work bee carry out on the site while the house was sitting. it i often made out that support of september sitting are reform and those who do not support them have their head in the sand and are look backward. in fact, there can be a genuine division of view on how member would most productive spend their time in september - whether that i in the house or in their constituency - and on how much time this parliament sit for compare with other parliament around the world. however, i wish to raise a more bore, domestic issue relate to the function of this place. i wish to cuss maintenance and the building bee fit for the purpose of enable meet to take place at which the govern are held to account. it i no use passe mote that say that the job of this house i to hold the govern to account - of course, that i it job - if we do not have a build in which that can proper be done. have lot of construction work go on around u a we carry out that function was not a happy experience when we try it before. when we consider govern bill, govern legislate or private members' bill, we try to form ourselves of all the issue involve. however, this house ha a terrible habit when we cuss this sort of domestic issue. the seem like a good idea, we vote one way or the other - if we are allow a vote on such matte - and then we pass on without any proper advice and information have been made avail to member. when i saw the september sitting mote on the order paper, i was please that it referred to this parliamentary year on. i took the opportunity to go to the chief executive office, where philippa helme i always very helpful, and i then spoke to john borley, who i the office in parliament responsible for all our build and maintenance work, along with mel barlex. i meet them regular because i was a member of the finance and service committee in the previous parliament and a member of the administrate estimate audit committee too. the meet were not always terribly excite, but they were crucial. john borley told me that they had right anticipate that the house might want to sit in september. with a new govern perhaps come in they could not guarantee that, but the thought was that it could happen and that at a beginning of a parliament, because busy might not happen quite so ear, there would be a need for legislate to come through then. a office, they right predict that september sitting might be held and they set their maintenance programmes up according. therefore, there will not be any dramatic effect this year in term of alter what was already in train and what was already bee planned. my concern i that on these sort of issue we do not bother to take account of the people who have to do the tail professional work in build up maintenance programmes that keep this build function, not mere a a place of work, but a one of the most important historic build in this country - that i important too. we have seen the work that ha been done on the cast - iron roof, which ha been crucial in keep the fabric of this build go. i know that in the past there ha been an awful lot of criticism of how we have manage the parliamentary estate. we encounter major difficulty with portcullis house and problem with the visitor reception area, and they create major problem for the budget of parliament. we have run over budget and over time on the visitor reception area, which was an happy experience from which we have had to learn the lesson. with the appoint of these new office to manage our parliamentary estate, i have seen a much high degree of professionalism, and a much great willing to plan ahead, to look at the option, difficulty and cost involve, and to see how we can develop a forward programme for budget, which i crucial. i have also seen the work of the administrate estimate audit committee and how internal auditor now work with it to try to ensure that we have b practice in procurement. office will say two the to u. first, they will say that they need a degree of stability and of advance warn, because it i not sufficient simply to try to pick, on a whim, when parliament will sit on a year - by - year basis. we need significant and serious forward planning so that parliament look, a quick a possible, at the longer - term arrangement over a numb of year and give the office advice about when it will be sitting and when time will be free to carry out essential maintenance work. the second the that those people will say i that if, have examine the situate, parliament i bent on have simply a f - week recess year on year, it will not be possible to keep the build in which we work - and that we treasure and have grow to love over the year - in a proper state of pair. if hon member have any doubt about the situate, they should take a trip down to the underground passage under the house to look at the state of the mechanical, engineer and electrical system, because they are very bad indeed. we know that a mass work programme will be need. that will need planning, organising and fund, and it must be cost - effect. if we can shut down the build for on f week at a time, it will probably not be possible to carry out the programme. it i not sufficient that i port these concerns to hon member second hand, so it i important that proper port are made to the commission and the finance and service committee, with the audit committee have a look, so that there can be a port to the whole house to form members' decisions. we should try to plan our sitting for a whole parliament, which would also help member to organise their activities outside the house. if we could achieve all that, we could better approach these issue that are crucial to our work, even though they are quite dry and sometime turgid matte that might not excite people political. it i also important that we send a message to the public that if we have to make cut to the service that they receive - we might agree about where the cut should fall and how great they should be - we will take proper account of the money that we have for the house and ensure that we spend it cost - effective. unless we carry out proper planning, however, that simply will not happen. it i absolute right that, if the govern wish, we should come back in september on the basis of the mote. however, if we are look at future sitting, planning will be require, a will proper advice from the office who run the palace of westminster for u. all member should have access to that advice before vote on such sitting in the future. a the hon gentleman acknowledge, cost i an important issue, particular with regard to maintenance and forward planning. when he look further to this for future year, will he ensure that the office are allow to produce their advice dependent and that it goes to the appropriate committee, and also that all member of the house have access to the advice that i given about the cost and the advisability of postpone maintenance programmes and not carry them out proper a office advise that they should be carry out?",-1,0.396,0.358,0.998

together with parliament, and therefore with the two scrutiny committee in particular - way in which, right across the piece, we can strengthen scrutiny and accountability to the house of parliament for what we a a govern do in europe on behalf of this country. in those conversation about parliamentary scrutiny, which i tend should begin a soon a possible, i hope that i can find complete agree with my hon friend. however, he will know that if we are talk about arrangement that will govern how both house of parliament deal with european busy and the process of scrutiny, we ought to be strive toward a measure that can command broad support in both house, and across all the political party represent therein. the bill i a radical piece of legislate to improve how we handle european busy. a my hon friend the member for new forest w point out, in a characteristically vigorous intervention, had the legislate been in force at the time, the treaty of lisbon, amsterdam, nice and maastricht would all have require a referendum before they could have been final ratify. the power in the bill include a referendum lock on treaty change or decisions that transfer power from the unite kingdom to the european ion. that i the case even if the measure use to transfer those competences or power are the extensive self - amend vision introduce by the treaty of lisbon. the power include require that important decisions - even if they do not transfer power or competence - are still in every case approve by an act of parliament. i want to put this beyond any doubt: the bill will mean that any treaty change at all, whether use the ordinary procedure for amend a treaty or the simplify revision procedure, will have to be approve by primary legislate. this i a vital need improve. under the european ion act 2008, parliament control over the simplify revision procedure and other key ratchet i limit to a vote on a govern mote. that i the case even if the simplify treaty change or ratchet clause are pose to abolish something a important a a national veto over foreign policy. we shall have a bate on the ratchet clause late this week when we deal with amendment to those part of the bill. i will be happy to go to more tail then, and i hope the hon lady will forge me if i do not answer h question now. we are give parliament and the public the opportunity to hold minister to account by spell out the criteria need to make a decision on whether the power or competence i transferred, and require minister to make a state give the reason for their decision. parliament can challenge this, and, if it so wish during the legislate process, add further condition of it own. if the public are satisfy with the minister judgment - i stress it will be the minister judgment, not parliament - they will be able to use judicial view to check it further. my hon friend i tempt me to go way beyond the scope of the bill. at the moment, any legal aid apply would be subject to the normal rule that apply to legal aid, which are the responsibility of the ministry of justice, and not of the foreign and commonweal office. the bill comprehensive goes through the nut and bolt of the treaty to identify how power and competence could be shift from this country to the european ion. we have deliberate and determinedly taken step to limit the wriggle room for any govern or minister in this regard. we are committed to ensure, a b we can, that the bill i watertight, with no omission or loophole that would allow a future govern to avoid give either parliament or the people the control that they serve. let me spell out in a little more tail how we plan to achieve this. follow the agree of any future treaty change under the ordinary revision procedure - that i, the process involve an intergovernmental conference and, probably, since the lisbon treaty, a convention of the european and national parliament a well a of national government - three condition must be fulfill before the unite kingdom could ratify such a treaty change. first, the minister must lay a state before parliament. that state would g the minister decision a to whether the pose treaty change would involve one or more of the criteria in clause 4 of the bill, and therefore whether a referendum would be require or not. a change that would transfer power or competence from this country to the eu would be subject to a referendum of the british people. if the proposal were consider by the minister not to involve one or more of the criteria in clause 4, it would be consider to meet the exemption condition - in other word, it would not quire a referendum to be held. the important point i this: the minister cannot simply conjure hi decision out of the air. he ha to obey the law. he ha to follow the criteria set out in the bill, especial those in clause 4 and schedule 1. hi state will have to demonstrate how he ha apply those criteria in come to hi decision. he will simply not have the scope in law to make some arbitrary decision in fiance of what i spell out in the legislate. the point are not vague. i invite the hon gentleman to have another look at clause 4 and schedule 1, both of which fine in clear term the various way in which competences could, within the term set out in the treaty, be enlarge, transferred or expand, while schedule 1 set out in tail a list of national vetoes, the removal of which would automatically trigger a referendum. i gently suggest that the hon gentleman study the bill a little bit hard. the second condition i that parliament approval ha to be gain for the treaty change in all case, no matte how minor or uncontroversial, by act of parliament. that legislate would provide for the approval of the treaty change and, where a referendum i require, provide the necessary enable measure to allow it to be held. the need for an act of parliament i central to our role in hold minister to account for the decisions they take on behalf of the uk in the eu. if parliament were of the view that a referendum should be require for a future treaty change, despite that proposal come in one of the exempt category, it could amend the approval legislate to provide for a referendum if it so wish. my hon friend i jump several bridge in assume that what might be pose in those hypothetical circumstance would be an amend of the european ion treaty rather than a separate intergovernmental treaty involve the member country of the eurozone - and perhaps some other - who wish to participate in the sort of close economic ion that my hon friend describe and fear. i hope to say more about this late, but the bill i base on a very clear principle agree within the coalition - that the referendum lock should apply where there i a transfer of competence or of power from the unite kingdom to the institute of the european ion. that i the define criterion. the different category of exemption apply where power and competences are not bee transferred from this country. that i the reason for the distinction set out in the bill. it i not an arbitrary decision, but one base on a very clear principle. if the measure in respect of great economic ion or perhaps fiscal ion or share responsibility for debt were to take the form of a european ion amend treaty and involve the transfer of competences or power from this country to the eu, the referendum lock would be trigger. if the eurozone country choose to do their own the and have their own intergovernmental treaty, which they can do quite distinct from any move to amend either the treaty on european ion or the treaty on the function of the european ion, we would not have a say - not if they chose to go down that route. by imply, my right hon friend ha answer hi own question. there i a question about national sovereignty and democratic accountability. we would look askance were another eu member to say that some protocol that dealt with the unite kingdom alone should be subject to a referendum in their country. we should be pretty cautious before we set ourselves up and argue that we will insist that we hold a referendum here on a treaty proposal that doe not have an impact on the governance of this country, that doe not involve the transfer of new power away from this country, and that leave the power of our parliament and people complete a they are at present. rose - i will make some progress, because many member have spoken and made different point, which i want to answer. a the house know, a new system for treaty change was introduce by lisbon: the simplify revision procedure in article 48 and of the treaty on european ion. that enable the european council to amend those section of the treaty on the function of the european ion that concern the single market, justice and home affair and other internal policy. the bill ensure that the method of treaty change, govern by the simplify revision procedure, i subject to exact the same accountability and scrutiny a the ordinary revision procedure. the on difference i the significance test, which i will cover in tail late. in passe, i should say that article 48 decisions about move from unanimity to qualify majority vote are caught by clause 6 of the bill and quire both an act and a referendum in accordance with schedule 1. my hon friend the member for hertsmere was right when he said that article 48 say that the simplify revision procedure cannot be use to enlarge the competences of the european ion. although that i indeed written in the treaty, we have draft the bill to quire british minister to examine even an article 48 proposal, to see whether, despite that treaty language, we would judge it to involve an extension of competence. if the british government judgment was that it did, the referendum lock would apply in those circumstance. let me turn to the numerous amendment, many of which severe weak the vision of the bill, either by water them down so that they are toothless, or by extend them considerably beyond what the coalition programme for govern promise. amendment 67 and 68 would move the referendum lock altogether, and quire on an act of parliament to approve a transfer of power or competence from the unite kingdom to the european ion. i was go to make the qualify that the amend apply to measure within the simplify, not the ordinary, revision procedure. i think that that deny the public the chance to have their say on what are, ultimate, important decisions. my hon friend the member for cheltenham ask a couple of tail question. he ask, for example, whether a technical change to allow for emergency flood relief, agree to by mean of the simplify revision procedure, would be subject to a referendum. a he will know, the so - call enable clause, article 352, would be avail in the event of a need to take urgent action within the european union exist competences if that action were taken to attain the eu's objective and if there were no explicit vision to authorise that in the eu treaty, and emergency relief and international develop are indeed competences that the european ion share with member state. clause 8 of the bill provide for enhance parliamentary control prior to any agree on the use of article 352. i agree with the hon gentleman on some of what he term technical change. i firm believe that a referendum should be held on any change that would transfer competence or substantive power from this country to the eu permanent. the hon gentleman also ask how many article 48 change were current bee consider. on one i bee consider at present, the one that was promote by the german govern and agree at the december european council. it affect on the eurozone, and a it doe not transfer power or competence from this country to the european ion, there would be no need for a referendum. amendment 1 to 5 and amend 7 would ensure that every treaty change require the sent of the british people in a referendum, even if it transferred no further competence or power from this country to brussels. i suspect that this was not the authors' intention, but even a treaty change that would repatriate power from the european ion to the unite kingdom would quire a referendum in this country before it could be accept. a treaty change to move the unite kingdom veto over decisions to amend the numb of advocate - general work in the european court of justice would quire a referendum, a would a treaty change to allow denmark to participate in justice and home affair measure. the addition of 18 new meps before 2014 - when they take their seat automatically anyway - for which the bill provide would also quire a referendum. the issue i this: what i a suit matte for a referendum? i believe that decisions that change who decide - decisions that move control over an area of policy from the unite kingdom to the eu - should quire the sent of the british people; but not every treaty doe that. should a technical change such a the temporary alteration in the numb of meps quire a referendum? if iceland decide to join the eu, should that quire a national referendum? i think that that argument i very hard to justify, and might well credit the principle of referendum from the point of view of voter. i also see no justify for referendum on treaty change that do not apply to the unite kingdom. a i said early, in democratic term, those are ultimate decisions for the country to which the treaty apply, and not for u. no transfer of competence or of power from this country to the eu i associate with such change. if we follow the hon lady logic, a referendum would be require in this country for any change whatsoever in the distribute of seat in either the european parliament or the council of minister. by definition, a referendum in this country would also be require on any accession to the european ion, not just that of turkey, because every time a new member state join the european ion they would have a certain weight share of vote in the council of minister and a certain numb of meps. i do not think that she i serious argue that. the hon lady and other hon member hon in on the question of turkey accession, say that the size of that country population made it a different case. that i not a straightforward an argument a she and other make out, because there have been occasion when a numb of different accession have taken place at the same time. a few year ago, 10 new member state join the european ion at the same time. i believe that their combine population then was 73 million, which i slight great than turkey population i now. i do not believe that anybody in this country argue at that time that a british referendum on those accession was right. the point of principle here i that a referendum should be require when new competences or power are given from the unite kingdom to the european ion. if parliament want to impose the additional require for a referendum to be held on a treaty change, include an accession treaty, parliament i perfect entitle to do so when the ratify bill come along. i am go to stick to my figure of 10. it doe not make much difference to the principle of the argument, but i believe my figure i accurate. my hon friend right made a point about problem aft some of those accession, but that make the case for member state to insist on the rigorous apply of the accession criteria before accession take place, rather than allow country in before they are fully ready and equipped and then argue about it afterward. i am grateful to the right hon gentleman for that. i wish now to cuss the significance test. new clause 9 would submit all referendum criteria, all treaty change and all use of article 48 to a significance test, but even the narrow use of the significance test, a set out in the bill, ha been the subject of a great deal of concern, so i wish to be clear about what it mean for the bill a it stand and to explain why it i need. the significance test can be use on in very specific circumstance. clause 4 identify 13 stance when a treaty change transferring competence or power to the eu would attract a referendum. the significance test apply not to 13, but to two of those stance. moreover, it can be use on when a decision under article 48 i bee taken. it cannot be use for treaty amendment adopt under the ordinary revision procedure. article 48 decisions could seek to confer on a european institute a power to quire this country to act in particular way, or to impose sanction on the uk for our failure to act in a particular way. although that could be done on within exist area of competence, and not within new one, it would enable eu institute or body to use those exist competences in a different way. a future proposal under article 48 to do either of these the would, a a matte of general principle, quire a referendum to be held. let me g the committee a hypothetical example. there might be a proposal to allow an eu agency to impose sanction on a national regulator or to act in a way that compelled british business to do something that would crease significant the burden on british busy and harm the competitive of this country. that sort of decision would, in my view, be class a significant and should attract the referendum lock, but there might equal be stance in the future - the hon member for cheltenham was right - where article 48 might be use to g a new power to a body in an area that i not significant to this country. for example, it might quire a national regulator or some other british organisation to provide an eu agency with a set of statistic annual. let u consider, for example, the european maritime safety agency. it was set up to provide member state of the commission with technical and scientific assistance in the field of maritime safety and the prevention of pollute by ship. if, in the future, it was decide to change the treaty so that that agency could issue bind directions to national regulator and that that would be a permanent cession of authority and power, that would be a significant power within the mean of clause 4 or. if, however, the proposal was to change the treaty to allow the agency to quire national regulator to provide it with an annual digest of statistic, i do not think that that would be a significant power under the bill. that i why we have provide for the significance test. amendment 3 and 5 would move the significance condition from the bill, so it would in practice quire a national referendum on such the a the vision of statistic. i think that most people in this country would accept that such technical change should be left to the govern, under the scrutiny of parliament, who of course would still have to authorise the minor treaty change through primary legislate - a formal act of parliament subject to tail scrutiny and cap of amend in either house. in all those stance the proposal would need to be thorough analysed and we have ensure that any use of the significance test would be subject to strong scrutiny and accountability. when he spoke about amend 11, my hon friend the member for hertsmere took a different approach to parliamentary scrutiny. hi amend would quire a minister to seek parliamentary approval not to hold a referendum on the basis of the significance test, through both house agreeing to a mote without amend. i have a great deal of sympathy for where my hon friend i come from and i do not for one moment challenge hi passionate commitment to the duty of parliament to hold minister to account or hi wish to see the power of parliament over european ion busy and ministerial decisions on europe strengthen and improve. if i felt that hi amend would secure that object better than the vision in the bill, i would be with him on the tail. however, i want to explain why i do not believe that it doe that. first, when a minister make the state require by clause 5 on whether a pose amend quire a referendum, they must g reason why the pose change doe or doe not meet the significance test. those reason will need to f to the criteria set out in clause 4, so their reason will need to be clear set out. there i a first measure of protection already in the bill. second, the bill ensure that every pose treaty change, regardless of whether the significance test apply, would quire the approval of parliament through primary legislate. that would allow sufficient time for parliament to scrutinise the use of the test to legislate for a referendum if it deem such a vision necessary. third, there i the risk that have a separate bate on significance in the way that amend 11 pose could weak parliament scrutiny of the primary legislate that the bill quire. that point was made by my hon friend the member for north east somerset in an early intervention. in view of the dynamic of the house of commons, it would be tempt for a govern who want to rush through a particular treaty change to schedule an ear bate on the mote not to quire a referendum and then, when the ratify bill came forward and member of parliament had had the opportunity to look at the tail, perhaps consider the evidence of a select committee, and list to what outside expert had to say on the matte, they would find their whip come up and say, "" we've already vote on this. you personal went through our lobby to support the position that a referendum was not require. how can you change your mind and try to insert the require for a referendum at this stage? "" the unintended consequence of amend 11 could be to strengthen the hand of the busy manage and to weak the dependence of judgment that member would be able to exercise under the require for primary legislate laid out in the bill. amend 11 would also weak any prospect of a successful judicial view. judicial view i not a panacea, but the house should see it a a significant step to g the citizen the right to challenge a minister decision, where that decision i irrational or reasonable. there are two important distinction between what we are pose here and what we saw in the wheel case, to which a numb of member referred in the bate. first, the minister ha to g reason, and g reason by reference to the bill. that open up the possibility that a court might wish to consider a challenge to the reasonable of the minister decision. second, whereas in mr wheeler's case the court was invite to judge the word of the constitutional treaty against the word of the treaty of lisbon and decline to do so, in this case we are talk about a possible invitation to the court to judge the action and decision of a govern minister in hi execute capacity against the statutory duty on that minister set out in the language of the bill. those are important distinction. no. i want to do justice to the amendment table by the opposite. they have been present a crease the role of parliament. in fact, they do the verse. the effect of the opposite amendment, especial new clause 9, i to subject every referendum criterion to a significance test. if accept, the opposition amendment would leave it open a to whether a move to join the euro was significant, a move to g new competences to the european ion was significant, a move to g up our border control and take part entire in a european immigrate system was significant, or a move to join a european public prosecutor system was significant. the hon member for caerphilly i try to persuade u that he i offer new power to parliament, when it i clear to anybody who study the word of hi amendment and hi new clause that the intention are the verse. the opposition amendment would drive a coach and horse through the bill. they would deny both parliament and the people the additional power and control which i believe parliament and people in this country want to see. the bill i design to be tough. a academic expert have said when give evidence to the european scrutiny committee, it deliver the referendum lock that we have promise. i will not yield by weaken the bill in the way that the opposite pose.",-1,0.366,0.562,1

- namely, that they do not reoffend. given that, both with custodial and community sentence, three out of f people do reoffend and that long - term prison are even more likely to do so, there i a great deal to be done. i will not go to that subject in tail. it was not include in the queen speech because it doe not quire legislate; it quire source and will. final on that matte, we will be judge not by the people who end up in prison but by the numb we prevent from have to be sent to prison. i want to get that on the cord. there are now a cord 66,500 people in prison - - almost 50 p cent. high than 10 year ago. that i not a cord to emulate; it i a cord to overcome. in this bate - - the final day of bate on the queen speech - - the govern will be make clear their priority, on the cord for people to see. those are the commitment to order, to effect police, to measure against antisocial behaviour, to form the criminal justice system and, ye, a it ha been mention, the sentence regime, a well a to reinforce civil and community pride - - act citizenship and community develop, which have been bad erode over the year and which must be lift to the top of the political agenda. this i not a job for govern alone; it i a job for our society, involve the develop of economic and social policy, fair and effect immigrate and asylum policy, equality of treatment and good race and community relate. what we need i not simply more legislate, but livery: govern and people work together to create a civilised society - - one that i enable to take the necessary action to ensure that people are not exploit or do not exploit other. that i the view we take in respect of the deplore incident in oldham and burnley. the message i clear, and my hon friend the member for burnley iterate it at prime minister question this afternoon. no one gain from order, antisocial behaviour or damage to people and property. no one will gain from what ha happen in oldham and burnley unless we learn the lesson rapid, not by conduct long inquiry, but by ensure that people sit down and work out action programmes together. we cannot have these matte simply referred up to govern, important a it i that we take action to support, to advise, and to look at the source and the fair of the way in which we treat these community. the community itself should take on the challenge and the responsibility of do the job. mobilising community, a part of the solute, underpin our think in several key area of home office responsibility and home office policy. on the cowley estate in brixton, which i visit two week ago, i saw people pull together to overcome the scourge of drug push and drug addiction. i saw people come together, work with the police to overcome the scourge of petty burglary and of antisocial behaviour. it ha been done in st. paul's in the walsall heath area of birmingham; drug push and prostitute were literal push out of the area. the right hon member for maidstone and the weald mention h visit to hackney. there are example across the country of community come together, support by govern national and local, support by and work with the police, to make a difference to their area. the policy of the home office will be to pursue that approach with vigour; the civic agenda pursue by the act community it within the department will engage with those issue a well. with regard to the prevent and detect and combat of crime, there can be no difference between politician about the objective. the issue i: how to set about achieve the goal. overcome order wherever it i, provide an answer to violent crime, will be paramount in store people confidence in the system. those trafficking in drug, in gun and in people must be first in the fir line of our policy, for all those people are our enemy, and that i why the proceed of crime bill will be so important to tackle the exploitation of other for the fit of a few. a the amend table by the liberal democrat this afternoon say, we will of course have to be vigilant about the safeguard of civil right and liberty, and the right hon member for maidstone and the weald made mention of that this afternoon; but those who would use the proceed of crime to buy the b legal advice in the country are not the victim but the perpetrator, not just of crime but of detriment to the life, liberty and freedom of other. no one, no matte how well - mean, should use the justice system design to protect the minority a a justice system to protect those who inflict justice on other. we must get the balance right. of course we must take care to ensure that we do not end up with the wrong presumption about the wrong person, but i make it absolute clear that there i no point in people willing the intent if they do not also will the mean. i just sound a warn. those who have the proceed of crime at their disposal will buy the b legal brain, not mere to challenge when the bill ha become law, but to lobby and take action while the bill i proceed through the two house of parliament. no one should make any mistake about that. i certain will not do so this afternoon; i am await, a i the lord chancellor, lord justice auld's port, which my colleague and i will consider careful. we tend to dovetail hi commendation with our own think and with john halliday's work, on which i shall com in the next few week. i can promise that we shall seek radical to improve the administrate of the court service in junction with the lord chancellor office and the attorney - general. it i important to do that if we are genuine to deliver justice speedily and fair. i do not think that there i anything between the hon gentleman and me on that matte, so the question on the mode of trial must be determine by the contribute that it make to achieve those overall goal. what i said about those who exploit other i equal true of those who fit from the misery of people who seek a better life across the world. our approach, our procedure and our effective must not encourage or enable organised criminal to exploit the immigrate rule and, in do so, to exploit those in desperate need. for the sake of success in develop community that can welcome and embrace those who come from oversea, and to ensure good race and community relate, it i absolute critical that we avoid justifiable fear bee enhance by organised criminal who clear exploit our immigrate process, mislead other about what will happen when they arrive here; and that we want an immigrate system that dissuade those whose claim of persecute i not justifiable from use other route. in the months ahead, i want, with my right hon and hon friend, to spell out how we can develop an immigrate policy, rather than simply have an obsession with asylum; how we can use a vise and update work permit system; and how we can enhance what we are do by consider the experience of green card proposal in place such a canada - - not to open the floodgate to people who believe that they can come to this country, but to provide sensitive and sensible route by which we can deal with genuine claim. the message to those who organise trafficking in people i very clear: we are not prepare to let them exploit those who land in our country on to have to be turn around and sent back. where a claim of persecute i well found, we shall deal with it quick and effective and - - to paraphrase someone else - - we shall ensure that there i a safe haven, not a soft touch. that safe haven must involve consider how we treat people better when they are here and how, when their claim have been justify, they are integrate not on in our community, but in our nation, so that we have a nationality policy, a well a an immigrate policy. it i time to draw a line under what happen in the run - up to the general election and for everyone, include those who com on public bate, to help u to look again at what we have been do so that we get it right. the home office team believe that the tremendous job done by my right hon friend, the new secretary of state for foreign and commonweal affair, and hi colleague ha been underestimate. i visit the immigrate and nationality directorate in croydon yesterday and was deep impress with the work there, a i have been by the work in liverpool and leeds and at our port and airport. the new invest in fingerprint, technology and the fast - track of case i beginning to work on because invest ha start to flow through and people are able to g time to those case that need it. a speedy appeal process - - together with the removal of those people who have fail to make a justifiable claim - - i paramount to getting the system right. turn - around time for new arrival i also important. however, that ha to be built on a measure of trust and decent invest so that it i possible for immigrate office and those who work with them at the point of entry to do their job more effective. the house must support those people who have the difficult job of removal, which was mention by the right hon lady. the labour manifesto said that in excess of 30,000 people who had not justify their claim would be move by 2003 - 04, which i about 2,500 people a month. we have decide that that target must be met by ear next year, which enable u to have a commitment to reach and exceed the 30,000 removal by 2003. there ha been no fiddle of the system - - i do not know about treasury website - - i have enough problem handle my own without examine what treasury official are putt out on the home office behalf. however, opposite member know, because they were vigilant in the run - up to the general election, that we dealt with the matte in april. it ha not just been announce - - opposite member may say that that doe not make it better, but they know that it was bate and in the public arena in april. i know about the inference in the story in the even standard and, this morn, the sun - - ye, i am an avid read of that newspaper; i want to cover what i happen and to take account of it. those story were not new. they may have been new lease, but that i all. let me spell out what happen and why. there was a clear reason why the issue arose in the spring. when people claim asylum a head of the family, it i their claim that i view to cover whether the allege persecute i well found. if the claim i agree, the dependants that they have brought with them are treat in the same way. if it i fuse, they and those who enter with them are move, which make them removal. i am bee heckle again, so let me put the arrangement on the cord. about 20 p cent. of justify removal are dependants. i promise the house that we will not on publish the numb of removal, but break it down to head of household and dependants. there will be no fiddle of home office statistic; instead, there will be clarity and transparency. we will bate those statistic open and fair. let me say one other the about removal. it i no good people right want to ensure that those who do not have a justifiable claim leave the country if, when measure are taken to move them, crocodile tear are she in the media. it will not be easy, and those who have to do it will have a difficult job, but it ha to be done. we are determine to carry the policy through because it will be a prerequisite to deal with, support and handle those who have a justifiable claim and allow them to remain in this country fair, open and without the incipient racism that was implicit in the bate that took place some months ago. that i why we need a high efficient system. i saw yesterday a mass speed up of that system, and a great improve in our ability to deal with people from the point at which they enter this country. there i still a grow backlog of appeal, partly because of the speed with which exist claim are bee dealt with. of course, there i a reduce numb of apply now - - 14 p cent. down on the previous figure. that i very welcome. it i no good the right hon member for maidstone and the weald mumble away. the figure to which i am referring are the year - on - year figure. the right hon lady knew that, because she i on top of the figure, but i hope that i am, too. i can certain underline my hon friend's tribute to those who have been employ, without whom we could not have achieve the turnround that i now taking place. i shall have a word with my right hon friend the chancellor about the open cheque book that my hon friend quire. another aspect of the queen speech consist of the police form measure. to achieve the consensus that we all seek in term of deliver a form agenda - - that consensus will have to range right across the police rank and to those who work to support the police force across the country - - we need to accept that rapid progress will need to be made. we need a modernisation programme a much for the sake of those work in the service a for those who re on it. the parity that exist between force performance are not accept. the parity in some high - profile but probably peripheral matte such a sick absenteeism, which vary by a factor of 80 p cent. across force area; the rate of medical ear retirement, which vary between 5 and 58 p cent; and livery measure, which we need to examine, all lead u to believe that change i need. that i change not on in regulations and manage but in the perspective on what the police force can do by work with other. we are therefore establish a new standard it, which will work with police service throughout the country, concentrate especial on the basic command it. it will work with the police on spread b practice, identify manage and livery problem, scrutinising the way in which work on the ground gel with wide crime reduction partnership and with our other policy, for example, on drug prevention and drug problem. i hope that the renew morale and motivation of those in the sussex service will lead to good recruit and considerably improve outcome. that i the intention of senior personnel in the force who wish to effect that. i shall not make a state in answer to a question from the hon gentleman. suffice it to say that i work within my power. i did not sack the chief constable of sussex. i suggest to the police authority, which will receive a port from lord carlile next week, that, aft three and a half year, it would be helpful if the matte were solve. i am glad that the chief constable help u to do that. the case emphasises the importance of an dependent police complaint system, which we shall introduce in this parliament. not on dependence, but speed and effective of operate are important. the right hon member for maidstone and the weald ask about bureaucracy. one of the standard it task will be to examine the current process, from the moment of arrest through charge and the criminal justice system to conviction. at present the process i euphemistically describe in home office parlance a attrition - - i hope we shall find a better word, and one which mean something to people outside - - which mean bureaucratic lay: the process to which i referred early in answer to the hon member for southwark, north and bermondsey. i hope that we can reduce that bureaucracy. i was please to accept the suggestion of my right hon friend the minister for police, court and drug that we should monitor immediate the way in which a police constable average day i bedevilled by form fill and procedure that must be follow. they include not on update technology, which, for many force, i stuck in the 19th century, but the actual process that constable have to undertake. we will do that because it will both lift morale and speed up the system to ensure effect outcome. i am grateful to my hon friend for the work that she ha done over the past three and a half year with hon friend represent the area cover by the sussex force. my right hon friend the minister for police, court and drug will be meet h and the family concern on monday. i hope that, together with the carlile port, the continue work of the police complaint authority and the considerable help of the police authority itself, we will be able to make sense of the matte without a further public inquiry. i am very keen - - this i the answer to the hon member for east worthing and shoreham - - not to go through the nicety of process, but to get action from every level to ensure that we deal with case fair and open, and that people on the ground know that police force are address themselves to the fair, just and safe police of their area for the sake of everybody in those community. rose - - i shall be cuss those matte with the secretary of state for wale and other colleague. i am happy to write to the hon gentleman in the meantime sett out where we are on that point. rose - - we have also taken responsibility for the drug it from the cabinet office and will be integrate livery and policy in a way that i hope will dovetail with our drive against organised crime. we have already said - - i simply repeat it - - that the job of the police, like that of the intelligence service, i to concentrate on the trafficking and push of category a drug and their dang in the local community. we shall be evaluate the experiment that command brian paddock of the lambeth division i undertake in london. i shall cuss with police authority how they can do their job better and more quick and be more account than some of them are at the moment. the job of home secretary i not to protect police authority but to protect the public, and while i am in the job, that i what we will do. no, i do not accept that at all. getting 1,353 additional recruit in the last 10 months of last year was a good indicate that progress was bee made. i shall spell out in a moment our intention regard open and transparent target - - in fact, i shall do so now so that we are clear about where we start and where we are go in term of police numb. we have a commitment to 6,000 extra recruit which will be achieve by march 2003. however, it should be absolute clear that police recruit and police in post are not one and the same. although we will fulfil the manifesto promise on police recruit, i am keen to set target also for police in post and full - time equivalent. let u assume that there are 125,500 police in post now and that we rapid - - by autumn - - reach the numb that the opposite always use which, if memory serve, i 127,158, the figure in spring 1997. in our manifesto we promise the great numb of police in post ever - - 128,280. let u say that we manage to achieve that by next year. let u then assume - - the previous home secretary mention this during the general election campaign, but it was not in our manifesto, nor i it a public service agree target - - that we reach at least 130,000 police within the lifetime of this parliament. i would like u to do better than that. if we do and if i am still home secretary when we do, i shall set a new target. i shall want the crime fight fund to be renew, because it was that fund and the direction given by the previous home secretary and hi minister that achieve the uplift in numb. the relationship between the chief constable, the police authority and the home secretary must be a posit one, because if parliament want more police and want them on site, in the street, avail, accessible, there to protect against crime and the fear of crime, we must work together to ensure that that happen. i hope that that satisfy the hon gentleman. my hon friend i quite right about that. i cannot g an assurance now on the meet of the various pension requirement that are pick up by the devolve police budget. there are enormous call on the police grant: i cannot call the exact figure, but a substantial percentage of the police budget - - about one fifth - - i now spent on police pension requirement, and there i an issue in term of the impact in different part of the country. none the less, my hon friend make a valid point that need considerate. i have spoken for longer than i tend, but i should like to speak briefly about the criminal justice proposal in the queen speech. we shall consult on the proposal from john halliday and lord justice auld; on the proposal made in the command paper "" criminal justice: the way ahead ""; and on other suggestion now bee made to modernise court service and the criminal justice system and provide a far more effect way in which to bring those who have committed a crime to justice and deal with them and to deal with sentence - - in other word, the possibility of a penal code similar to those which apply in other country. i off the opposite party an opportunity to participate. there are few country in the world that have the constant bate on these matte and the constant change that we have. there i more legislate than it i possible to spend time read in this area. no soon ha a bill been passe than another one i bee passe to update it. i am still investigate which order exist that have not yet been laid. the process goes back donkey year. over the recent past of the home office, the entire department ha been gear to legislate. it i time to get a grip on what we want to do, to settle it in this parliament, and to allow our successor to settle down to implement what we decide. i off the opposite party the opportunity over the months ahead to work out, without prevaricate, whether we can find consensus on the criminal justice system with the lord chancellor and the attorney - general. let u see whether we can work out a penal code and a sentence system that are follow by the most appropriate measure to stop people offend, to reduce recidivism, to ensure that people are re - integrate and to protect our community. i off back benchers the opportunity to come forward to work with u, and to bring forward their suggestion on how they would wish to proceed. it may be that the opposite party will not wish to take up the opportunity. obvious, the main opposite party will have to consider the matte follow it leadership test. however, it seem to me that it i time to stop the knockabout in this place and to deliver to those whom we represent. not a single lawyer. i did not say that.",-1,0.273,0.343,1
461,"would the minister not agree that the logic of hi position i that universal benefit should not exist? in that event, why are women and children bee target for the loss of these universal benefit? why not pension, who might not use their winter fuel allowance to pay their fuel bill? they might use it for something wholly inappropriate, such a buy a new pair of shoe or a piece of clothe. why are women and children bee target in this way? ear in the minister introduction to the bate, one of the reason he gave for not go ahead with the save gateway account was that there had not been enough take - up by bank. he also argue that credit union did not exist in every deprive community, and that they would therefore be able to operate the save gateway account adequate. i think that he was putt the cart before the horse. the save gateway would have given the credit union a huge boost and allow them to develop. the credit ion in my constituency i fragile, because it serve an area in which people have difficulty save. they might wish to borrow, however, and to do so through a credit ion i much better than use some of the other method on off in the area. it i difficult for credit union to balance their save and their borrow, even without taking to account their administrate cost and all the other expense that they incur, and they need to get volunteer to do the work. so, if we want the credit union to grow, we need to assist them, and retain the save gateway account would have been one way of putt credit union such a the one in my constituency on to a firm foot. if a credit ion i not an example of "" the big society "", i would like to know what i. i believe this illustrate a fundamental coherence, which we can see in many of the policy present by the coalition govern. they have a lot of the word and a lot of the language - in fact, i sometime think that govern member are steal our language - but if we look at what i bee done a oppose to what i bee said, we see the truth. here i an example of something that should be encourage a part of the big society, which we are all suppose to be support, but some of it lifeblood i bee cut off through this policy. another coherence i seen in consider what type of benefit we should have. a i said before i was elect, we all need to cuss that - i am not suggest that my party ha no need of further discussion - and i shall carry on say it. do we want universal benefit or not? if we have them, ye, there are cost. personal, i would have been happy to see child benefit made part of tax come in a more coherent way. if we want universal benefit, ye, there are tax imply. there are some strange consistency around. i may have imagine it, but i thought i heard the secretary of state for busy, innovate and skill extolling on the radio yesterday - several time throughout the day on the bbc - a policy that he claim the govern would adopt over the next few year: provide pension and give the current rate of mean - tested pension credit to everybody over pension age. i think that would be fantastic, especial if we could further reduce the dependence on mean - test. many of my constituent, particular those just over pension credit level, would feel that that was fair. there i a huge cost, however, which would have to be paid for. i that real the policy of the coalition govern, or on that of one party try to tract attention from the comprehensive spend view? can it be the policy when we have heard today all sort of argument against universal benefit bee made very strong by conservative member? i found it quite offensive to hear some conservative member scribe what they thought people might use their heal in pregnancy grant for - it i not necessarily ease by other benefit. that i why i have referred to coherence in the policy, which need to be sort out. it i right for u to expose it. we have different view on how the economy work and on how to get out of the cession. we could go to all sort of history lesson. the 1930s are often mention, but we have to go beyond 1931, 1932 and 1934. there i a strong economic argument for say that we did not get out of the cession until re - armament start before the second world war. it can also be argue that the uk went through a double - dip cession in the mid to late - 1930s. economist agree, of course, but none of u should take such an absolutist position a to suggest that we are simply right. we have a view; you have a view - i am sorry, mr speak, you do not have a view. the coalition govern have a view, but we should be prepare to list to alternate point of view.",-1,0.456,0.365,0.998

we have no regret from the bank and no acceptance that they play a part in event. let u consider their behaviour over bonus. let me finish my point and i certain will. the behaviour of the bank over bonus at the senior level i obscene and offensive to every one of our constituent. at a meet on saturday morn, i spoke to someone whose wife work for halifax. she i go to lose h job. if one speak to people in every part of the community one find that they are look forward to 2011 with great worry and concern because more than 100,000 of them are go to lose their job in the public service alone. excuse me for a second. given the amount of money that the state ha pump to the bank to rescue them, it i unacceptable that bank and senior bank still, at this stage in the game, demand obscene bonus at level that many people could never think of earn even when they have work all their life. that show a state of mind that i not exact right. we hear that if all that doe not work, bob diamond will take busy away from the uk. what on earth i the point of spend time build up a regulatory structure if that i the attitude? for safety, i join the hon member for bromsgrove in think that glass - steagall i a good alternate, but fortunate for u both, a we move in that direction the governor of the bank of england seem to be move in the opposite direction. we can never pin that man down, can we? i think that i the direction we should go in. in the minute that remain, i shall explain the reason other than safety why i support a move in that direction. i know that this might mark me out a old - fashioned, but i want the tail bank to go back to the fine role that they have historical play in finance individual and small and medium - sized enterprise. that was their function and they did it very well, but that ha been lost because the emphasis ha shift to the invest side of bank. if we are talk about rebalancing the economy, the engine for grow must be the bank. if we can get them to move across to their old role and let the investor go off and play their casino game, our real interest will be satisfy because we will get people in the financial world to focus on the productive side of the economy.",1,0.187,0.161,0.997

"" the rule of law enforce by the court i the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitute i base. therefore, this i not just declaratory; it i a response to what i happen. when i first came to the house in 1979 it would have been conceivable that anyone would even cuss the sovereignty of parliament, because it was so much a part of the fabric of how the nation had been govern, and how it understood it govern, over near three century. we all know that the doctrine of the sovereignty of parliament can be a tyranny. it i, aft all, on a temporary majority in the house of commons that can change our constitute and our law. that knowledge was held by the house and form the great bate that lord hailsham try to start when he spoke of elect dictatorship, even though he was make a wide point about change to the constitute. it was certain, however, that this house was sovereign, and that that could be borne because no house of commons can bind it successor. that create tolerance for any action that came to be seen a tyrannous, because they could not be held beyond a parliament. that became a reality when we became a democracy. i g a cheer for my right hon friend the member for wokingham and my hon friend the member for stone - who should real be my right hon friend - for remember the constitutional development involve. the house ha now lost any sense of narrate about who we are, what the house i and what this country i. i weep when i hear labour front benchers - and the right hon member for rotherham - these day. some of them were not here when the wonderful pet shore was in the house. in 1982, speak on a referendum bill just before the election, he stood up and said that it was conceivable that a whole generate of british parliamentarian had given away the most sacred trust and the the that they prize most: democratic self - govern. that i always what this ha been about: who i the master? the master i the people. i think that the american revolution was the third stage of the english revolution. in fact, we are the representative of the people, and it i their continuity and their fortitude that we pend upon for the very survival of this house. during my time in parliament a lack of trust ha develop in the protestation of govern that nothing i real change. we are told that we do not have to worry our head. honourable minister have stood at the patch box and told me that nothing ha real alter, and that in substance we are where we were. that i not borne out, however, by what ha happen. the line of direction - where this i all head - ha become painful clear. it was clear long ago. the occupy field was referred to early, and i see close by the secretary of state for work and pension, who made hi reputation a a newcomer to this house of commons and was advise that hi career was ruin. that i one of the torture that i extend to everyone. a i look around the house, i see many who were elect because they gave undertake to their constituent that they profound believe that there was a need for an expression directly on behalf of the people on the issue that front u. i am very interest to see how we drift when we come to the comfort of these green bench and we forget the solicitation of the prospect of office. we will forfeit the good will of those we count a our friend if we march toward a conclusion that i not now, i think, that of the british people. let me make the argument about why i think this affirmation of sovereignty i important. it i because i have seen in my time in parliament - i am, of course, old than i look, to my regret - the gradation of the sense of the british people that ultimate, they control their govern, through general election. everyone in this chamber will have met the disillusion and the despondent. "" it doe not matte what we think, "" they say, "" we are rule by other. "" i have already mention pet shore, but there was also tony benn, who had a fivefold construction for the question of whether we are a democracy. i have always fine the issue down to two of hi question, which seem to convey the essence of the point. first, who make the law? many of our people are deep fuse about that. are they made in this place or elsewhere? the second question he ask was: how do you get rid of them? the british people have face those puzzle for a long time now. we do not know who make the law - i am talk about the generality of those whom we represent. they do not know. "" i it parliament? "" "" no, it i the european ion. "" we play up to that game. on the front bench, they always pretend it i always someone else - "" we are on do what we have enter to because of a treaty obligate "" - but treaty are, of course, subordinate to legislate. we never emphasise that enough. the crown make treaty. the common law i subordinate to statute. we do not state that loud enough when we are front with judge who are now try to pose that arrangement are not quite a we understood them. they know the tyranny that parliament can be. we are the element that should make this bear by the people whom we represent. we are their representative. a i was mind by my hon friend the member for north east somerset, the second treatise of locke, which form the american revolution, also form our view of constitutions. it mean that we can never g away that which i their. yet we have done that throughout the time i have been in this house. i support the amend not because i want to, but because i think it believable that parliament i bee ask to affirm the sovereignty that ha been a feature of our constitute for 300 year, a interpret by constitutional writ, and that we are now seeing judge who equivocate. there are now two legal order in the country: the european legal order, made up for themselves by the court of the european ion, and our own legal order. i believe profound that the latte must take precedence, and that i the assertion of the sovereignty of parliament that i should like to see in the bill. i cannot imagine how the house of lord will look upon this "" expression of sovereignty "". sovereignty i a given, yet now it i question. my final point relate to some of what ha been said in the speech to which i have listen today. the act of govern, and the act of parliament, are an expression of self - confidence a well a self - govern. what i have witness i a fearful cower, and a series of executive who accept the, with modify, and "" triumphs "" are always declare.

the crown was sovereign once. it i intrigue that we are more than two hour to this bate but so far we have talk on about parliamentary sovereignty, even though the sovereignty technical still belong to the crown in parliament. we all know about the event that took place over several hundred year, particular when they were accelerate during the 17th century revolution and crisis. there was a large transfer of power from the crown to parliament. when a sufficient large transfer of power take place from someone who was sovereign to those who would be sovereign, a point i reach at which that sovereignty passe because enough power ha been surrender and the arrangement have change sufficient. a other member have suggest, we need briefly to look at how that very big transfer of power occurred in the 17th century from the crown to crown in parliament and, in due course, effective to parliament stand on it own. one important factor was that parliament was very good at aggregate power to itself. in those day, it decide to be very nice to bank, which work very well for it, because it got the city of london and the men of finance on it side. in those day, the english navy did not have french ship in it, and parliament made sure that it respond to the english parliament. parliament also took the precaution of hire and train and pay - something quite usual in those day - the b army in the country. it got over the problem of compete army and, in due course, establish that it had military power and could command the army. parliament also need to deal with the judge. it was establish during the revolutionary period that judge were necessary and that, accord to our current tradition, they had to be dependent and should not interfere in parliamentary matte by try to make the law. they simply had to deal with the law a parliament provide it. we therefore eventual end up with a very powerful parliament. in the 19th and 20th century, parliament did something that everyone in the house i now unite in admire: it made the exercise of power by parliament a democratic matte by extend the franchise until practical every adult in this country was able to participate in election. that gave parliament the authority of have a democratic voice and mandate. the question that we are bate today i whether that great democratic settlement, in which most member believe, i now under threat from judge - made law, from european - made law and from other centres of power. could parliamentary sovereignty come under pressure in the not - too - distant future? i it bee damage because too much power i bee transferred? these question account for the nervous, certain on the conservative bench, about the degree of power that ha already been surrender by success parliament over the year, particular under the most recent govern follow the treaty of nice, amsterdam and lisbon. under those treaty, a large numb of area were transferred either to joint decision taking or to sole european decision taking. that mean that the exercise of power in many important area of activity, include regulate, the expenditure of money and the vision of public service now emanate from the continent. those power are try to establish their own democratic credibility through the european parliament. they are also try to establish their own judicial credibility through the european court of justice, and their own administrate credibility by strengthen the power that are exercise around the various collect corporate table that constitute the ever - evolving, and ever more powerful, european ion settlement. the nub of our bate today i whether there i something that this parliament could and should do, no matte how much power ha passe, how many decisions are taken through the european ion and how much money it now take to itself and spend on our behalf, to make it clear that, should we want those power back, we can have them back. if we wish to change or moderate what the european ion i do, do we have every right to do so because we are still the sovereign? some of u fought long and hard to keep the currency under british sovereign control. these arrangement involve a british sovereign and preserve the settlement of the queen in parliament, and the queen face appear on the banknote of the realm, but we all know that they are parliament note and that they represent an expression of parliamentary sovereignty. indeed, it was this very parliament that, by a majority, approve the previous government decision to print a lot more of those note - or electronic note - a an expression of what that sovereignty can do for the people of britain. we can argue about whether that was a good the or a bad the, but it was an undoubted expression of sovereignty. indeed; the hon gentleman make a powerful point. i, too, would like u to opt out of the common fishery policy. i would like u to elect a govern in this country who had the necessary majority to go off to brussels and say, "" it i now the settle will of this parliament that we want different arrangement for fish, and if you will not grant them through the european ion arrangement, we would like to negotiate our exit from the common fishery policy. "" that i exact the kind of negotiate that many of my hon friend were elect to achieve, and, had we had a majority, we would have want our govern to do something like that. there are a numb of other policy area, some of which are more political contentious across the floor of the house, where we think we can make better decisions here than are bee made in our name by the european ion. if such renegotiations could be achieve, we would clear have assert, or assert, the sovereignty of our parliament. if, however, they can never be achieve, it i difficult to see how parliament could still be sovereign. if we are say that nothing can ever be change once it ha been agree under the various procedure in brussels - include the many measure that the british govern did not want or on which they were outvoted - we cannot say that we are sovereign any longer. we would then be in a relationship with the european ion that would fall short of our preserve parliamentary sovereignty. tonight we are cuss a narrow, but crucial, legal issue that ha been well highlight by my hon friend the member for stone and the european scrutiny committee, whose perception i first class in form the bate. i do not need to repeat all those argument. suffice it to say that i support the important amendment pose by my hon friend. a i understand it, we have a govern who say that they wish to do all they can to assure people in this country that we are and tend to remain sovereign. they do not wish to pick a fight with brussels, and we are not ask them to do so tonight. they say, however, that should a agree arise in future that cannot be solve through the usual channel, it will be settle here. i am very much in favour of that; it seem to me to be a wholly admire and sensible place to take the bate. if that i the intention, it prove that parliament i still sovereign. we are argue on about the word use to carry out that intention. it i one of those rare magic moment when the conservative party i complete unite on it intention. the government intention to assert parliamentary sovereignty warm the cockle of conservative members' heart. it i wonderful to know that in another bate we can have a referendum when anything important happen. there may be some argument about what i important, but we welcome the spirit. again, we are at one with our govern. when eminent lawyer and colleague who have study this matte at much great length than i have say to the house that they have study it careful, that they have what sound like moderate and sensible word that basically repeat the government policy and that it would be helpful if those word were written to the legislate, my feel i - unless the minister ha a very powerful speech come up - what i wrong with that? if the minister want to assert parliamentary sovereignty, why cannot we just say that in the bill? it i exact what my hon friend say - it doe not seem difficult, so will the minister please humour u on this occasion? the fact remain that if we succeed in amend the bill in this way, we would not be truly sovereign in future unless we had the will and termination to shape our own destiny, should the need arise. i hope we can do it by agree. any sensible person wish to do it by agree, given how far we are in this the with our european partner and what a mess they are in. withdrawal from the common fishery policy was not in the manifesto, although it might have been in the personal manifesto of some of my right hon and hon friend. i gave it a an example because i believe it ha a great deal of cross - party support. most people think the common fishery policy i extreme bad run and i not in the interest of the fish or the fishermen. cast all those dead fish back to the sea i not my idea of conservation and it doe not bring cheap fish to the fish market either, so it doe not seem to be good new. success government have always said that they quite agree with those of u who make such point, but they have never manage to negotiate a better deal. would it not be wonderful if the govern said, "" if we cannot negotiate a better deal next year, we will use british parliamentary sovereignty to pull out of the cfp ""? i would like to do that and i do not think it would be tantamount to leave the european ion. it would be pretty cross, but it would probably do a deal with u because it would be more embarrass to have a sovereign parliament taking unilateral legislate action than to do a deal. i hope the eu would do a deal; it would be sensible for it to do so. if we are not prepare at some point to assert our power, we lose our sovereignty. just a the crown lost it sovereignty, became the crown in parliament and eventual lost practical all it real power, so this parliament i lose it power. if it goes on lose them, without sensible vision bee made of the kind pose by my hon friend the member for stone and without at some point stand up for a better deal for britain, this parliament, too, will no longer be sovereign. will the minister tell the house that he wish to assert parliamentary sovereignty and resist judicial incursion, even if he will not put that in the bill?",1,0.417,0.436,1

perhaps i should begin with hi long service in this house, and hi rather short stay in the other house. hi great oratory was admire by many, even when they passionate agree with him. while the people of bethnal green and bow chose unity over division, and while my politic could not be more different from mr galloway's, we have one the in common, which i know that the house passionate share - a deep commitment to a last settlement in the middle east. for me, that i impossible without end the blockade of gaza and a viable dependent palestinian state alongside a secure israel. i would also like to pay tribute to my labour predecessor. oona k was a hard - work, dedicate mp for almost a decade, who fought for people who suffer enormous from the appall house condition in the east end of london. she fought relentless to tackle poverty and equality, both in this country and in develop country. we member the late lord shore of stepney who work tireless for the people of my constituency. he ha a special place in the heart of bengalis, especial among my parents' generate, for the way in which he l member on both side of this house to speak up for the fight for democracy in the war of dependence in 1971 in bangladesh. i am on sorry that he i not here today to see someone born in the country he support, brought up and educate in the constituency he represent, elect to this parliament. my passe for bethnal green and bow i about the place, the people and our political heritage. i would urge hon member to go east and visit place such a the whitechapel gallery, columbia road flower market, and spitalfields market near brick lane. brick lane ha iconic status in this country, both for it vibrancy and cultural activity and for it extraordinary history: for bee the place that provide a home for many wave of migrant, include the huguenots, jews, irish, pakistanis, bengalis, somalis and many other, manifest poignant in the brick lane jamme masjid, which was built by the huguenots for christian worshippers, late became a synagogue and i now a mosque, reflect the different contribute of so many to our great country. in other part of my constituency i come across people who mind me of the courage and termination of so many in the east end. i think of the elder lady who survive the blitz but overnight lost h family, and the many other story of sacrifice and loss, such a the bethnal green tube aster, when 173 people lost their live seek shelter from air raid in 1943. we owe it to those east enders never to forget that freedom are never easily won. for me, it i an honour to stand here, a a successor, i hope, to the great social reform of the past, who took idea born in the east end, develop them and change this country for the better. it i no exaggerate to say that the east end inspired men and women to make history and fight for social justice. i think of the trade ion movement, the suffragette and the welfare state. my constituency sit between the glitter tow of the city of london and canary wharf and i a stone throw away from the olympic village. the olympics have the potential to deliver huge opportunity and a sea change in attitude toward our country, our pride and our sport ability, yet many in my constituency remain convinced that they will benefit. i hope that the job opportunity and the legacy that we wish to create will benefit them, and i am acute aware that it i an extraordinary opportunity for an historical poor part of london. i want to speak on behalf of those who face the rough few year ahead. already, employment i credibly high in my part of london. the east end ha been in that situate too many time before, and for u waste talent i never a price worth pay. in the cession of the '80s and '90s i saw family, friend and neighbours lose their home, job and livelihood overnight. that was the time when the liberal controlled the council and the conservative ran the country. any community that doe not provide useful work for it people risk fall apart. it i not that people in the east end lack resourceful; on the contrary, it i impossible to walk the street without seeing the energy, dynamism and drive that take whatever source are avail and turn them to success. but when programmes such a the future job fund are shut down, the govern send a message to thousand of people, say, "" you're on your own. we wash our hand of you.

war, the question ha been consider under a labour administrate in 1968, a conservative administrate in 1983 and a labour administrate in 1999 - 2000. on each occasion, the position was confirm by an overwhelm cross - party consensus. on each occasion, amendment could easily have been move in the house by those who support an end to the ban, and vote on. on none of those occasion, and on no other occasion that i can call, ha this ever been a matte of act pursuit for member of any party in this house. significant, and to echo the point made by the hon member for harwich and north essex, neither i nor my staff can call one letter, among the hundred of complaint from prison with which i have dealt in my 32 year in this house, call for the right to vote from prison. i turn to the european convention on human right and the strasbourg court decisions. the convention was draft principal by distinguish british jurist, include david maxwell fyfe, who was late home secretary and lord chancellor in conservative administrate. the convention i a fine state of what we all understand to be fundamental human right. a an instrument, it ha stood the test of time, and i strong support it. one key problem for many year aft the convention was agree in 1951 was that, in contrast to most signatory state, it was not incorporate to our domestic law. that meant that the unite kingdom was much less likely to be given the latitude offer to other country - the so - call margin of appreciate - by the strasbourg court, because our court were not able to adjudicate on the convention article. i spell that out in the time this morn, and i was just about to come on to that point. i am grateful for the cue from the hon gentleman. the human right act 1998 i part of the solute to the problem; it was never part of the problem. i shall explain why. we have not been able to enjoy the margin of appreciate and our court have not been able to adjudicate on the convention article. the first attempt to deal with that issue in the house was made in 1987 by the then conservative member of parliament, the late sir edward gardner, qc. hi private member's bill fail aft receive considerable back - bench support from all part of the house, but scepticism from the govern and opposite front bench. t year late, i was privilege to do what t gardner had begun with what became the human right act 1998. in the end, it gain all - party support, a proceed on third read show. important for this bate, and to answer the hon member for gainsborough, the white paper precede the human right act was entitle "" right brought home "". it was about repatriate british right in the convention that we had provide for other country in europe, but that were not avail to our own citizen. rose - the tire law lord, to whom the right hon member for haltemprice and howden referred, ha recent said that the human right act could be "" a perfect serviceable british bill of right "". that, in essence, i what it i. the act was expert draft. it gave the court the power to declare primary legislate compatible with the convention, but no power to strike down that legislate. i agree entire with my right hon friend, and i thank him for hi support. like any former home secretary, he know how difficult but vital it i to balance right, liberty, duty and obligate in that very high office. the hon gentleman i taking u to wide territory. i happen to think that the problem i not the plain text of the convention, but the way in which it ha been over - interpret to extend the jurisdiction of the european court. i will come on to that point in a moment. i do not, however, subscribe to the view that the 1951 convention i the last word on what should be in a bill of right. i share lord hoffmann's view that it i a very good start point. there i a wide issue - a rabbit hole i do not tend to go down if the hon gentleman will forge me - about whether we should have a written state of our key constitutional right. i think that we should, and that the sovereignty of parliament should be right at the top of it. however, that i a separate point. rose - i was not in the house in 1965. i was cause trouble at university at the time, so i have an alibi - i was at the scene of some other crime. i do not quite subscribe to the hon gentleman view about that piece of history. the sign of the protocol that gave the court that power was very public. anyway, where we are i where we are, and subsequent administrate of either persuasion have not object to the court have that power of what amount to individual petition. our human right act was expert draft, give our court the power to declare primary legislate compatible with the convention but no power to strike down that legislate. in that way, the sovereignty of parliament i respect and indeed protect by the act. our senior judiciary, without question among the b in the world, have apply the act with the sensitivity that one would expect. a the right hon member for haltemprice and howden said a moment ago, when the british court first consider the hirst case, prior to it go to strasbourg, they found no breach of the convention whatever. in addition, they said that any change in the law was a matte for parliament. for the avoidance of doubt, let me put it firm on cord that the tense and conflict that we have to solve today can in no sense be laid at the door of the human right act or, in my judgment, at that of the plain text of the convention. rather, the problem ha arisen because of the judicial activism of the court in strasbourg, which i widen it role not on beyond anything anticipate in the found treaty but beyond anything anticipate by the subsequent act sent of all the state party, include the uk. in hi major lecture two year ago, to which reference ha already been made, lord hoffman spell out in eloquent tail the difficulty that the situate was cause, include for the uk judiciary. he said that the strasbourg court "" lack constitutional legitimacy "" in intervene in matte "" on which member state... have not surrender their sovereign power "". he add well - found criticism of the high variable quality of it judge and administrate. where the court ha given judgment against the uk in respect of fundamental human right, success home secretary and uk government have readily comply, whether on specific case, such a terrorist deportation, or on matte such a the need for proper regulate of phone - tapping and the intelligence agency - and so ha this house, whether or not it agree with what the court was say, because we have voluntarily and readily accept it jurisdiction. no, they are not, and i will come on to that. the fundamental distinction to be drawn i this: all of u, a i have just spell out, are require to respect and observe decisions of the court on fundamental human right, because it was in respect of those that we and other country sign up. no, i have to make progress. the issue before u today - here i the heart of the matte - i by no stretch of the imagination a breach of fundamental human right. rather, it i a matte of penal policy, which the minority of judge at strasbourg - and very senior they were, too - said should be left to the uk parliament. through the decision in the hirst case and some similar decisions, the strasbourg court i sett itself up a a supreme court for europe, with an ever - widen remit. that i why the tense that i mention now threat to become a collision. even in country with supreme court much more powerful than our, there i a democratic override of their decisions. for example, in the unite state or germany, which have very strong court that can strike down primary legislate, the courts' decisions can be overridden by, for stance, democratic amend to their constitutions. there i no such democratic override avail for decisions of the strasbourg court, so we are face with a court judgment follow which, without warrant from the treaty to which we sign up, we a elect mps are expect to do the opposite of that in which we believe. my predecessor a lord chancellor, lord falcon, and i wrestle for f year to find a way through the problem. initial, lord falconer view was that the require on u follow the 2005 hirst decision was simply "" to consider careful the basis "" of our law. he went on that it could be the case "" that it i a proportionate conclusion that all people who are convict and sent to prison cannot vote. "" he began one consultation, and when that was conclusive i launch a second. however, unless and until i found a way - if one exist - that could satisfy the strasbourg court, this house and the british people, there was no appetite throughout the house, or among our whip, for me to bring forward legislate proposal. i understand the right hon and learn gentleman point, and hindsight i a wonderful the. if i thought that the on the prevent the court from come to a reason compromise was the fact that i had not organised an early bate, i would be happy to be taken to strasbourg to make my apology. he know better than anybody than neither set of whip was keen on such a bate, not least because it was clear that it would be impossible, particular in the pre - election atmosphere, to have the sober bate that we are to have today. that i true. i shall now move on. our mote ha been careful draft. it i respectful of the court and our treaty obligate, but i tend to answer one of the three objection that the majority of the court in strasbourg had to our so - call blanket ban - that there had not been any substantive bate on the matte in the light of modern penal policy and human right standard. this bate i a response to that. one cannot judge the fair and effective of penal policy with reference to just one aspect of it, such a the ban on prison vote. that judgment ha to made in the round. since the strangeways riot of 20 year ago and the woolf port that follow it, there ha been a quiet revolution in penal policy. a the chief inspector of prison have recognised, condition for prison have been transform. every effort i right made to treat prison with dignity, and to prepare them better for the outside world. the overall environment of our prison stand up to comparison with any in the world, and i far above that in many european country. however, the exact mix must be for domestic parliament to decide. they have the knowledge and legitimacy to make appropriate judgment, and we have supervise by our court of our executive administrate of our prison. the ban on prison vote i part of the mix of our penal policy. it i the subject of wide sent among the public, and at least of acquiescence by the vast majority of prison, a the silence of our postbag make clear. our mote i tend a part of a process better to strengthen the hand of the uk govern in argue in strasbourg that the majority of member of the court are seek a change in uk legislate which, on the face of it, i difficult or impossible to deliver, and in invite them to find a construct way forward. two objection to our approach have been raise. one i about the example that we may set, and the other i about compensate. on the first, the argument i that if we fail fully to implement the court decision, we will be able to put pressure on other who also have outstanding court judgment against them. that argument doe not take account of the reality of the situate. there are score of a yet enforced judgment against country such a russia - but not just russia - for egregious breach of human right, and for preside over standard so low a to lack any notion of fair trial. if i thought that our acquiescence in the court decision in hirst would be the instrument for a change in approach to those recalcitrant country, i might be persuade to drop my objection for the great good. however, there i no evidence of that - indeed, i suggest the verse. by extend it remit to area way beyond any original conception of fundamental human right, the court in strasbourg i undermine it own legitimacy and it potential effective in respect of the purpose for which it was establish. in other word, the court and the council of europe would have great success if they rein in their unnecessary excursion to member states' policy. in that way, we might see some of those judgment better enforce. this i my last set of point and i shall be brief. on compensate, i simply say this: there are many prediction that the court in strasbourg will award compensate against the uk govern, but a yet there i no certainty. in 2005, the strasbourg court deny hirst compensate. unless the court now see the purpose of compensate a some kind of gratuitous fine on the elect british house of commons, i fail to see by what algebra or alchemy any court could equate the absence of a vote for prison, which almost no prison of their own volition ever sought, and which still few would exercise, with some monetary amount. i am strong support of the human right act 1998, the council of europe and the text of the convention. i seek no train wreck, but a solute -

evidently, justify. prison who have not been convict or sentence to a term of imprison are able to continue to vote. no one would argue with that, because those people have not gone beyond the bar at which they would be able to vote, so i do not understand the hon gentleman point. rotherham. it may not have been strong, but it was true.",1,0.207,0.263,0.998
619,"my right hon friend ha already accept the dang of the cost of an open - primary system. doe he not also accept that, in logic, a primary system i essentially a process of electoral eliminate, whereby weak candidate fall away and those who support them end up help to decide who final win? that very logic ha been criticised in the alternate vote system. sure the real issue i about how we get to a point at which every member can truly say that they have a measure of mandate from a majority of their constituent. that give u the alternate vote. several hon member have spoken about fair and proportionality, and on that basis i support the liberal democrat amendment. people have referred to the irish example, and i am very familiar with the electoral system in the irish public and the similar - although until recent not exact the same - verse of the single transfer vote system that we have in northern ireland. the irish people mandate that system for u when they vote for the good friday agree, which promise that the northern ireland assembly would be elect on the basis of stv for the very good reason that people want it to be fair, inclusive and proportionate. so, i have strong sympathy with the liberal democrat case. when it come to council by - election in northern ireland, dail by - election in the sou and the election of the irish president, stv morphs to and, in effect, run a an alternate vote system. it stand out a a very good the when it come to elect a key figurehead, such a a national president, because people want the person who embody and i meant to epitomise the value and spirit of their country to have the clear endorse of at least a majority of it citizen. the alternate vote system, a a result of stv, ha those benefit, but i am realistic enough to know that the real issue tonight will not be about the single transfer vote and first past the post. in many way the real issue i not even about an outright choice between the alternate vote and first past the post; it i about whether, in principle, there should be a referendum that at least put the choice before the public. parliament ha been embarrass not just by the fact of the expense scandal, but by the ridiculous fact that none of u ha been able to explain or excuse outright, first, how information was suppress for so long, then, how the were handle and mismanage and, even now, the fusion about what form there will or will not be. parliament vote for an dependent parliamentary standard authority and receive the kelly port, but now there i fusion about which measure stand, which will be vise and which will not. so, at a time when we a a parliament are open to ridicule, it i the height of arrogance for u to decide that the public should never have the right to say, "" there might be a better way of elect people to parliament so that mps might have a bit more credibility aft all this. "" the hon member for cannock chase said that we have to decide what parliament i for - why we elect mps. it i not just for u to decide why people elect parliament, however; the public can decide. if the public are given a referendum on such an issue, they will have a say on the quality of the mandate that they want their mp to have. the public will have a right to say whether they are able to trust themselves to express an hon first preference and consider second and third preference, or whether, for their own ideological reason, they just want to plump for one candidate. we should g the public the choice to have that choice, rather than say that they cannot cope with it. some member cannot cope with choice because they cannot cope with fill in form and justify the, but that doe not mean that the public cannot cope with clear and hon choice. so long a we have the first - past - the - post system, elector will be lock to situate in which they have to calculate possible tactical vote while bee browbeat by all sort of propaganda about who i the on person cap of defeat another party. people are often misled: they do not cast their hon preference and support party with particular policy; they surrender their vote on the pure negate ground of try to prevent somebody else from bee elect. rather than putt the in the hand of those who come up with the b propaganda and the most mislead graphic on electoral trend, sure it i much better to put the in the hand of hon voter - not the honest spin merchant work on behalf of political party. we should make sure that the election of an mp i not decide by the people who control all the party list and manage the. we should make sure that the overall election outcome i not decide by the parties' target of swing voter in the battleground constituency, who become the on people to determine election. i have heard a lot from conservative about how under the alternate vote system everybody vote i not the same and how it mean that those vote for small party end up have a bigger say than those who vote for big one, but that i not true, because everybody vote count equal in the end. the people support a system with unequal vote are those who fend first past the post, under which the election will be decide by a very small fraction of target swing voter spread throughout the uk in marginal constituency. let u be hon about some of the argument bee made. i have a particular reason for want to move to a more proportional system; if the on one effective on off i the alternate vote, i shall vote for that this even. my reason i to do with the experience in northern ireland. whenever we negotiate the good friday agree, one of the the that some of u did, late in the negotiations - particular when the then prime minister tony blair was present - was to argue that we also need a different electoral system for the northern ireland seat at westminster. we argue that on the ground that, if we were to make the power - share assembly work and to make inclusion work, and if we were to create a new political ethic, we would not have very much success if every time a westminster election came along we were convulse back to sectarian impulses - have to vote orange and green. the think would be, "" which green candidate i most likely to beat the orange one? "", or, "" which orange candidate i most likely to keep out the green one? "" in northern ireland, we still find ourselves constant drawn and suck back to those sectarian, tribal instinct. some of u are committed to try to allow politic to move on and to bring about the emancipate of a new political ethic in northern ireland; it will be bad for that project if we stay stuck with first past the post, which keep u trapped in sterile argument. in the 2001 westminster election, sinn fein ran an essentially geo - sectarian campaign of "" green the w "". some of u made the hon choice not to go to sectarian electoral pact; we believe that the party should stand on their own distinct principle and we were fight our cause. my party suffer a a result of that principle, because the instinct was, "" we have unionist mps in a numb of constituency in the w of northern ireland who represent on a minority of the electorate. "" that fact was deep resent and l to people say to u, "" if you're not go to stand out of the way, sorry but we are go to bypass you and vote for sinn fein so that we can take the seat. "" that ha not particular help the political atmosphere in northern ireland; it doe not g voter a full and hon choice. now, the conservative party say that it will come to northern ireland so that everyone, regardless of background, can vote for secular politic and for party of national govern. of course, the conservative start off with a kind of "" new force "" axis with the ulster unionist party and then they seem to dabble in discussion about a more pan - unionist pact that might be offer. the party i trapped in that situate, despite what might be it hon good motive; i do not know about those, but i am not here to cast doubt on them. the conservative party find itself dragged to that precise because of the first - past - the - post system. if the party i hon and serious about come to northern ireland and make a new, hon off of it manifesto, the on way in which it will credibly do that i if it support a change in the first - past - the - post system. i thank the hon gentleman for make that point, but i do not accept it. our experiences in northern ireland so far have been in multi - seat election where people general transfer to various other candidate whom they think might stand a chance of winning. in election to a single seat, transfer cross party line much more; and we increasing find in election general that there i a bit more transferring across the line. however, elect an mp on the single - member constituency model involve a significant different relationship. why should mps in northern ireland not have the incentive to be much more active cross - community in their appeal and be able to stand on much more of a cross - community mandate? that would be to the good of politic in northern ireland, and it might add to the weight and credibility that mps from northern ireland have in this house, instead of our just bee seen accord to the colour of our political faction with no other agenda or mandate behind u other than that we were lucky enough to scrape through because of how the work out in our constituency accord to first past the post. i believe that this i an important step. i cannot dissuade anybody from feel scepticism or cynicism about the motivation behind pose it now, but i see very posit opportunity in it. i hope that the committee will vote tonight to show confidence in the electorate. if people are confident enough to trust the electorate with the first - past - the - post system, why do they not trust them with a referendum that would allow them to make a choice between that system and one that ensure that they have more control over electoral mandate, and where it i less to do with the luck - almost the electoral scratchcard - of first past the post? rose - i thank the right hon gentleman uncynically for bee so generous. he i suggest that minister do not believe the argument that they are make. doe he believe the argument that he make - that the referendum i wrong because it will off a choice not between pr and first past the post, but between on av and first past the post? if he real believe that argument, will he therefore vote for lib dem amend?",1,0.407,0.138,0.999

"" we accept hi good intention, but we want to ensure that the were pinned down a firm a possible. we welcome the minister state that he did not tend to put anything in the way of such an agree. we took the view that there was a hierarchy of way in which it could be approach. undertake to move obstacle - well, not object to do so in the first place - we took a a given. he indicate that he was keen to see obstacle move. one of our commendation i that the minister take posit step to facilitate a long and robust iba and to move any obstacle, whether practical, legal or otherwise, that may exist. clarify whether there are obstacle to a 10 - year iba bee sign now would move a lot of the anxiety about whether the european ion i block this or any other agree. a the second line of pursuit, we want a voluntarily enter - to 10 - year iba agree before any such sale. there seem no reason from what we heard from the minister, given that he was willing to overcome any obstacle, why a voluntarily enter - to iba could not be sign before sale took place. we said: "" we understand that this may affect the marketability of royal mail, but it i essential to the sustainability of postal service in scotland. "" we appreciate that royal mail sign an iba might affect the price that it achieve, because it might be seen a a less attract commercial operate than would otherwise be the case. we none the less agree that we want to include that because the preservation of post office through the construction of an iba and it implementation before privatisation or a change of ownership was absolute vital. no, we took exact the opposite view. we accept that royal mail would probably want to have the post office network. that network i important to royal mail, but it i not utter and absolute essential, whereas the verse i not the case. it i a question of ham and egg. the pig make a much great commitment than the h, so we took the view that, if there were a privatised royal mail or a change of ownership, which i free to negotiate with post office, it would be likely to drive a much, much hard bargain. it would seek, for entire understand commercial reason, to drive the post office network to the ground a much a possible, to extract the maximum possible advantage from those negotiations, because it would not be directly responsible for the future of the post office network. that i why we took the view that the post office position was likely to be strong before any change of ownership, so it was b agree now, rather than late. no, i do not agree with that at all, because i do not believe that a structure will be establish for royal mail that necessarily allow all shareholder to come round and cast a collect vote on whether they want to maintain a collect post office network. it will be in the management interest to maximise the turn for the shareholder, so screw the post office to the ground will probably be in their interest. i am sorry if my comparison about ham and egg, and chick and bacon was not understood. the concept i that the pig provide the bacon, and the chick provide the egg. the chick can carry on afterward, but it i not quite a easy for the pig. i am sorry if that i beyond senior member of the conservative party, but we are prepare to explain these the to them late. turn to the question of how we can secure the strong possible commitment to the iba, a pose in the new clause, which the committee had not seen when it prepare it port, we thought that have that in legislate would be an extreme strong protection. if the minister can g u an assurance that legislate i not necessary because the same the will be achieve without legislate before there i any question of a sale, then, because we are reason, we would be satisfy. however, the house will understand our anxiety, because aft the by - election on thursday, the minister might not be here any longer. we want to make sure, while he i in a position of authority, that he allow hi heart to rule and produce measure that we find accept. i should like to touch on one or two other worry issue relate to the post office. on the size of the network in scotland, we accept that the government access criteria are helpful in sett out the structure of the network that they want. we welcome, too, the fact that they tend to keep 11,500 post office. however, it i not the case that the access criteria necessarily mean that the 11,500 will remain, because our understand i that the access criteria could be met with 7,500 post office. a commitment to 11,500 i not necessarily a commitment to the 11,500 that are there at the moment. it would be possible in those circumstance for a substantial denude of the post office service to take place in the highland, the island, the border or argyll. rural area could maintain the present access criteria, and the 11,500 criterion could be met because other post office might set up elsewhere in urban area, but the service would undoubted be worse than it was before. the minister shake hi head. i would welcome a commitment from him that the intention i to maintain the network pretty much a it i. i genuine understand hi difficulty. individual post office are controlled by individual private tractor. we cannot legislate to fuse somebody permission to leave. there will always be some degree of come and go. if it were one in, one out in a particular area, we would not object to that, but there could quite easily be a couple of hundred post office go out of the rural area or the poor area, and a couple of hundred start up in the rich area where need i perhaps less. the minister criterion would still be met, but the social objective that we are pursue would be lost. the committee unanimous welcome the point that the minister was make about the access criteria and the fact that he was guaranteeing, a i understood it, 11,500 post office, but sure he will accept that hi guarantee doe not guarantee the same 11,500. it doe not guarantee them in the same location. in some area, particular rural area, where there are small post office, the access criteria are, thankful, better met. one of those could easily close, one could open somewhere else, such a london, and both set of criteria would still be met. if the minister cannot g u a commitment today, perhaps he will take that away and consider whether something could be done at a late stage in the passage of the bill. i think that he accept that this i a genuine anxiety and that we are here to help him. we are identify gap in vision and try to strengthen the bill. the hon gentleman serve with me on the scottish affair committee. a he will member, we were not commend that there should be a change to the legislate on this point. unanimous we agree that putt it in legislate would be too difficult, and we understood the minister difficulty in identify a policy that would encompass these point. but we want to raise the matte again because it was raise with u on a numb of occasion by people who could see how the government commitment could, in effect, continue to be met while there was none the less a deteriorate in service. the minister ha made the point that the tractor are dependent. if somebody leave a post office, somebody else will have to decide whether they want to take that on. aft the next election, there may well be a numb of liberal democrat look for new job, and they may consider whether to become sub - postmaster. so, i am actual think of the minister a much a anything else. he might wish to become a sub - postmaster in those circumstance, and, to turn to a previous point, i am sure that he would much prefer a 10 - year, or what might then be a f - year, guarantee with royal mail to one of on a few week. again, it would be for hi own good. that seem like a very construct way of look at the issue. i am not sure about the practicality, and nobody else raise the matte with u during our discussion, so we have not introduce it a a commendation. we were interest in the outcome, however, and we had sufficient faith in the minister and hi support staff to identify way in which it could be achieve. that bring me to the other point about which we had anxiety. it relate to the point about the numb of outlet, and it i the issue of wander van. the govern have committed to a certain numb of outlet, and the minister ha indicate that he want to have 11,500, but an outlet can be a van that stop for a certain period at a locate and then move on; it doe not necessarily have to be a post office. we have already heard how some sub - post office and outreach facility were not consider adequate, and the hon member for banff and buchan describe how people had to queue outside some of them in the rain and snow. the facility were not always satisfactory, and we worry that the govern will be able to meet their target of 11,500 by introduce a numb of wander van that go to f place a day, f day a week, mean that 25 outlet are cover. so, 100 peripatetic van - to use their sunday name - would cover a substantial numb of the 11,500 outlet that the minister identify, and that i clear not what we tend. it would therefore be helpful if he indicate the criteria that will apply when decide to introduce a wander van. i he willing to state that there will be a maximum numb? we do not want the commitment to 11,500 outlet undermine and value by there bee not even full - time van, but part - time van that appear for on a limit numb of hour p week. that i the final area of the pose change on which we want the minister clarify. again, if he doe not feel able to provide it today, i hope that he will find it possible to produce appropriate statement before the legislate i finalised. perhaps it would be helpful if we clarify whether it would be possible, without an iba, for royal mail to do a deal with tesco, other supermarket and a numb of bank, and to fill in the miss part of the jigsaw with post office. sure that i the alternate that we ought to be worry about. that i the dang of go down the road indicate by the hon member for folkestone and hythe. he seem to think that the option i between the post office in it entirety and tesco in it entirety. a predatory royal mail could easily decide to pick and mix. the dang i that we would be left with a small numb of post office, with the re place willy - nilly by tesco and the like. could we possibly agree, first, that the eu i a bad the? second, i the minister tell u that he doe not wish to have the new clause in the bill in case the eu step in, while also promise u that he i go to do all this anyway?",1,0.319,0.345,1

they could have put it before u this even, so that we could have bate this matte knowing what they tend. we are happy with that, sir michael. then the minister may carry on in that vein. the conservative are very much in favour of the government proposal in clause 30 and 31, and schedule 4, because democracy pend on accountability, which in turn quire sanction. it i astound that it i on at this stage in the develop of our democracy that such sanction are bee introduce. i cannot blame the current govern for that, because that develop ha been go on for century, but i am please that we have such measure before u now. they are right not just because of the example that we have seen in recent months, but because, a a matte of principle, it i right that such sanction are in place. my right hon friend the member for witney, the lead of the opposite, ha made it clear on many occasion in recent months that he thorough support the government proposal. he ha also made it clear that if they did not take action, any future conservative govern would do so. i am therefore please that they are taking action today. i share the concerns of my right hon and learn friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham and the hon member for somerton and frome. for the sake of brevity, i shall not repeat what they said - the minister i already prepare to answer the question they put to him. i was concern about conviction outwith the unite kingdom, but i am reasonably satisfy that schedule 4 take those matte to considerate. the hon member for somerton and frome ha ensure that the minister i consider the matte and i am sure that the latte will g u a clear answer in a few minute. sufficient safeguard should be in place so that all the circumstance surround whatever accusation a member of the house of lord face are consider. evidence should be taken and the matte should be fully examine by the house. otherwise, we will not have an open, fair and just system. i mind the minister - although i am sure he need no mind - and the committee that in circumstance such a those we are cuss, justice must not on be done, but be seen to be done. i hope that the question of justice bee seen to be done also encompass the concerns express during this short bate, and i am sure that the minister will be able to address them. i entire agree with the minister on retrospectivity; it i vital that we do not introduce rule that are retrospect and therefore unfair. i am sure that the minister i about to address the few concerns that have been express. i hope that he will convince the committee that the vision should be add to the bill and we will in that case support them.",1,0.477,0.614,0.999

"" otherwise, it seem to me that the liberal democrat real are taking to heart the word of home simpson, when he said: "" weaselling out of the i important to learn. it what separate u from the animal - except the weasel. "" i know that the hon member for bristol w i not a weasel, and i know that none of the honourable people current sitting on the liberal democrat bench are either, so i hope that they will stick with their manifesto commitment, which was to vote in favour of vote at 16 and 17. the most recent vote on the matte, held before the general election, was a free vote for labour member, and the labour party will have a free vote again this even. i happen to support vote at 16 and 17, simply because we ask young people to do many the in modern society, and they are age in many way. we now expect them to take on significant level of debt, and to consider do so before they go to university, and i honest believe that if they can make decisions about whether they can parent, about whether they have children, i think that they should also be able to decide who govern the country. that i not the precise proposal in the amend before u, because it relate mere to the referendum, but i think that general election vote should also apply to that age group. i am afraid that i find the amend that the hon member for altrincham and sale w table quite disturb and pleasant. i am not over - egging it. remarkably few people have migrate to my constituency of the rhondda over the past 80 year, except from ireland and england, so this i not an issue about who i and i not able to vote in my constituency. however, i rather like the fact that some element of our law on citizenship are slight fudge. i like the fact that we still emphasise the bond of the commonweal sufficient to be able to say that if an australian work in this country in a bar a part of their gap year, i resident here, pay their tax and i work, by virtue of their citizenship of australia they are allow to vote. let u f to the public of cyprus. many north london conservative mps would reckon that it was not without the cypriot vote in the general election that they were elect. in addition, if we were to franchise the large numb of greek cypriots in north london and, for that matte, sou wale, we would be say to them, "" please don't engage in the british political system, "" and do so at a time when their engagement with the british political system enable u to engage better with the problem in cyprus, which i still a divide island, with a divide capital city and all the problem about which this committee know. of course i want to encourage people to take up british citizenship, but our legislate i shape a it i because of mrs thatch. she introduce the british nationality act 1981, follow by the presentation of the people act 1983, which guarantee citizen of commonweal country the right to vote in this country. i very rare say so, but on that occasion mrs thatch got it right. i think i might have lost the rhondda there. there are other occasion on which i do not agree with h very much. let u take another stance. papua new guinea was never a british colony. it was an australian colony and, therefore, part of the commonweal, but i light in the fact that, because the main sport in papua new guinea i rugby league, papua new guineans come to the uk. there are some significant and famous papua new guineans play that sport in northern england, and i am light that while they are here, they want to take an act part in british politic and are able to vote. for that matte, i am light that fijians, in significant numb, want to join the british arm force. all hon member will want to pay tribute to the role that fijians have play in iraq, in afghanistan and elsewhere. fiji i no longer a commonweal country, because of the situate in suva, the military regime there and the fact it doe not seem to have in place a direct course back to democracy, so i ask the minister, why have we not amend the list under schedule 3 to the 1981 act? doe he feel it right to leave it precise a it i? i say to the hon member for altrincham and sale w that the bond that i cite in relate to the commonweal also apply to ireland. it i pretty difficult to unpick our entire historical relationship and the steady process toward peace on the island of ireland, but through the hon gentleman amend there would be a real dang of him do so. i value our relationship with the public of ireland. it i important that british people be able to continue to vote there, and other here. the hon gentleman may be about to raise the issue of whether the relationship should be directly compare, and perhaps it should be, but my instinct would be to say that if one want to move toward great compatibility or to reciprocal arrangement between different country, one should do so through a presentation of the people act, not a referendum act. that i quite interesting, because rather bizarre i spent a lot of the general election in spain, try to help british people get home during the ash cloud problem. indeed, it was a difficult to get to spain a it was to get back, so it was a slight complex mission. i am conscious that about 1 million british people live in spain, and that about 800,000 live in france, and many exercise a right to vote because they have a second home either in the uk, spain or wherever. however, when they no longer participate in british society, it i difficult to see why, aft 15 year, they should continue to have the right to vote a an oversea voter. in actual fact, the numb who use their vote i infinitesimal. that i partly because of the difficulty of vote by post. i suppose that arrangement could be made for vote in embassy, consulates - general and so on around the country, but i am not sure that it i worth the effort. aft 15 year, there i a good argument to say that if someone ha no direct invest in the future of the unite kingdom, then it doe not apply. the hon gentleman i sitting next to the hon member for altrincham and sale w - a man who just describe himself a an eternal optimist. they are both so optimistic that they are still referring to me a a minister, which i a light. of course, the hon member for broxbourne know perfect well that that i not the argument i am make; i know that because he did that little shrivel - up of hi nose that he sometime doe when he i about to make a mischievous contribute in bate. the basis of my argument i that the bond of the commonweal are important, and i have given a couple of stance of that. we have significant numb of people from these various community in the uk. many of them have been resident for some time, pay tax and tribute to british political life, and i would like them to be able to remain in the same situate. the situate i not broken, and so, to use an old conservative principle, i do not see the need to fix it. particular in relate to the public of ireland, it would be a step complete in the wrong direction to try to unpick the relationship that we have manage to maintain over the past few year. another issue that ha been touch on on slight relate to the oversea territory. we should consider, not directly in relate to this referendum, but certain in relate to the future, how oversea territory are represent in the text of the british govern. there i an degree to which we still decide matte for the oversea territory. for stance, in recent week the govern have decide to overturn the decision on borrow in the cayman island and allow the cayman island to remain a a tax haven. i believe that that i entire a mistake, and that the finance of cayman are sustainable. it i therefore important that we find some mean of ensure that the oversea territory have some form of presentation. i want to ask the minister a couple of other question about why the govern have introduce the clause precise a it i. i presume that we will not have a clause stand part bate, so i will mention these point now, if that i all right, m primarolo. i do not understand why pee should be allow to vote in a referendum on election to the house of commons. that seem slight odd, because all the other vision relate to those who are able to vote in election to the house of commons. perhaps the minister will be able to enlighten u. in particular - this may be down to my personal stupidity and ability to read legislate - undoubted it i, ye. i see that the hon member for worthing w ha swapped side and decide to join the rank of the labour party: he i very welcome. i ask the minister about clause 2 early, so by now he might have had some inspiration from the official. no, i see that he i not go to get any inspiration from them because they are all shake their head furious. the clause make vision for pee whose on right to vote will be by virtue of bee able to do so through the city of london - for stance, a an alderman - and therefore not by virtue of their residence. precise how many people doe he think that that catch? can the minister tell u about the position of the bishop? a he will know, some bishop arrive in the house of lord automatically and some arrive on a sort of episcopal escalator that take them up there once they are among the longest - stand bishop of the church of england, a long a they are diocesan, not suffragan or area bishop. what happen to bishop once they are no longer taking their ex officio seat? will they be allow to vote? what vision doe he think should be made for the future? i am hop that it i some time distant yet. i hope that it will not be on 5 may, but so far we have not won any of those vote. i hope that the hon member for altrincham and sale w will press hi amend to a vote, and i look forward to push lot of leaflet through door point out who he ha decide to franchise. i hope that the amend table by my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire i carry. i look forward to putt lot of note through door in liberal democrat constituency point out who they have chosen to franchise because they are not prepare to follow up what they truly believe. i hate to say it, but i agree with that last sentence. in offer solace to conservative back benchers, the minister seem to suggest that he i active consider whether commonweal citizen should be move from the franchise for parliamentary election. i that true? that i clear, and i am grateful to the minister. can he answer the question that i ask early about fiji? a far a i can see, the minister argument i that we should use the franchise use for parliamentary election, but he make one enormous exception, which i for the pee. it i not a small exception; it i a large exception. these are the people who are least experience in deal with parliamentary election. i say that not because i have any distaste for pee - some of my b friend are pee. indeed. nevertheless, what i the logic behind the minister argument for specifically exempt the pee?",1,0.367,0.303,1

grow mountain of waste and planning rule that do not allow local people to stop the unending march of mobile phone mast technology. the farm in our area still try to preserve the countryside, yet they are drown in paperwork and bureaucracy. the pressure on guildford are immense. go sou from guildford, my constituency stretch down to the sussex border, with beautiful village and countryside in which one can still find real pub, proper village fair and village green. i am not quite sure how warm the bee i, but suffice to say that during the campaign, the village pub brought colour to my skin, lighten my weary bone and were a welcome rest place for me and my footsore troop. guildford, and even the town itself, still ha strong local community and charity, so people have a strong sense of belong there. many of our charity pick up shortfall in statutory service and the benefit that they provide are almost always entire fund by local fundraising event. the save to the state due to such charity i immeasurable. charity that are concern with heal care include the beacon centre, which off help to people affect by cancer and other serious long - term ill and also treat people with lymphoedema, and christopher's, which off spite and support for family and children with life - limit illness. many mental heal charity fill the gap where state vision i woeful adequate. we also have cranleigh village hospital, which was found in 1859 a the first cottage hospital in the country. it i still open today on because of the stubborn effort of the local community. every time that closure raise it head, fundraising by the local community save the day. in 1998, the people of cranleigh decide that the on way to avoid the repeat threat of closure was to own the hospital, so cranleigh village hospital trust was born. seven year late, with land from a local benefactor and considerable local fundraising, they are ready to build their own new hospital. the people of cranleigh have had enough of promise about the nhs. the village will ensure that it ha the hospital that it want and serve. guildford ha a generous community in which people willing care for those less fortunate than themselves. guildford might look like a prosperous and content place, but we have our problem. crime and antisocial behaviour keep people in their own home, and worry about mrsa stop people attend accident and emergency department. people stay in their car and put up with traffic jam because of the woeful adequate public transport. we have ever - soaring council tax and significant area of privation, and guildford, like many other place in the sou - east, need a fair deal from the govern. i train a a nurse at barts hospital in london, of which i am immense proud, and work in the nhs for 25 year. i have four children and should also declare that my husband i a doctor. that background gave me the opportunity to work with people from all walk of life and understand the issue that those ordinary people face day aft day. the experiences of the people whom i have met over the year in my work, and more recent on their doorstep, will never leave me. when i sit in these magnificent surround and am treat wonderful by the staff here, my constituent and their individual story will sit by me every day. the gap between people and politician ha never been great. people feel a long way away from where decisions are made and feel that they are not listen to by govern at all level. i look forward to the experiences ahead and the opportunity to tribute in this place to reinforce my belief that a difference can be made and that the govern can list and change their mind through rigorous bate. indeed, if people start to see argument and bate change the course of event, perhaps more of them will start to feel that it i worth vote and that politician are worth vote for. i thank the house for listen to me and the people of guildford for elect me. i will do everything in my power to bring politic close to people, to ensure that the govern list and to change the live of those in guildford for the better.",1,0.391,0.492,0.999

821,"my right hon friend pray in aid merseyside, but he should not take that argument too far, because wirral now ha a lot of undersized constituency, while knowsley, which i represent, ha a very large one. it doe not always work out perfect. my right hon friend need to realise the fact that, because wirral end up with undersized constituency, one constituency in knowsley appear altogether. it was not done a a nice statistical exercise. it was basically done on the prejudice of the people of wirral, who did not want to be seen to cross the riv and be consider a part of liverpool. it i a great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for foyle, who always speak with a deep understand of northern ireland, with a great passe for northern ireland, and, of course, with eloquence. i was elect in a by - election in 1986 to represent a constituency that was then known a knowsley, north. i represent knowsley, north in the house until 1997. follow early boundary change - a public inquiry had been held before the boundary were final fix - i end up represent a constituency known a knowsley, north and sefton, east. i represent knowsley, north and sefton, east for 13 year. in the meantime, the boundary commissioner came along again, and i now represent a constituency known a knowsley. i therefore speak a one who ha experience dramatic boundary change in my constituency on two occasion. i think it instruct to examine what happen on both those occasion. on the first occasion, when the boundary commission pose that the knowsley, north constituency should be couple with sefton, east, a public inquiry was held. different view were express on either side of the boundary about what was and what was not appropriate. people had their say. i attend the inquiry on more than one occasion, and heard the bate about what link exist between the two constituency. two fact emerge that tipped the balance. the first was that a large numb of people live in the sefton, east part of what subsequent became the knowsley, north and sefton, east constituency work in knowsley, which was an industrial area. the second was that many people travelled between the two constituency for leisure purpose. the leisure centre in kirkby, which was in the old knowsley, north constituency, was heavily use by people from maghull, aintree and melling, so a link was establish, but it would never have been establish - nobody would have even check the statistic on this - unless there had been a public inquiry. in the end, the original boundary commission proposal stood and the new constituency was form; it became a parliamentary seat at the 1997 general election. my constituency second boundary change took place before the last general election. i made some comment about the wirral early and, on reflection, perhaps i overstate the case. i think i said that we end up with the boundary we have got because of prejudice on the part of the people in the wirral. prejudice i probably too strong a word, so let me tract it. however, what did clear emerge was that because of the argument put by the people of the wirral, we have undersized constituency in that part of the county of merseyside than on my side of the riv in knowsley. it i rather like a county. i will come on to county short, because i realise it might sound a if i am argue against myself. let u consider constituency within a county with reference to the idea of a balloon. if we squeeze some air out of one part of it - air bee the elector - it will emerge somewhere else, and it emerge in knowsley. i now represent a constituency of just under 80,000 people, whereas some member of parliament in the wirral represent under 60,000. the government argument would be that if we equalise that, it would not matte, but i honest believe that 80,000 elector i too many for an mp to be able to represent adequate. it i not that, a the hon member for epping forest said, i am too lazy or competent to do that; it i just real difficult. i now want to talk about some of the practical imply of the two change i have experience. the first of them i to do with represent a constituency that i partly in two different boroughs. the knowsley, north and sefton, east constituency was slight less than half in sefton with the re in knowsley. many member on the govern bench represent area where that i already the case, but most of them are probably not in metropolitan district. for member with constituency that are in a metropolitan district rather than a shire county, the power of local authority, primary care trust and so for are much more important and much more focus. for 13 year, i represent a constituency that had two primary care trust, two hospital trust, two local authority and two different area police command division, and deal with that i very difficult. apart from the practicality of need to keep list of everybody we have to deal with, we deal with area that have different kinds of crime, different kinds of heal problem and different kinds of relationship with their local authority. that doe make a difference. my hon friend the member for ogmore and for blaenau gwent made that point quite well, and i support it. now if, a seem perfect possible under the vision in this part of the bill, we start to say that county boundary can also be cross, the problem could be compound even further. at some point, my constituency i right on the edge of w lancashire - indeed, it i on the edge of a lot of other constituency. it i perfect possible that if this bill goes ahead a it i, my constituency could end up contain part of lancashire, a could the constituency of my hon friend the member for st helens north. that would involve a whole different set of relationship, and my hon friend and i could find ourselves motor up and down to preston on an almost daily basis in the recess a we try to represent another county, a well a the metropolitan county in which we are locate. i do not think that that would be impossible. aft all, two tunnel and a bridge run between the two area, and there i a proposal for a further bridge. i do not think it would be beyond the wit of man, or even my hon friend and i, to commute either under a tunnel or over a bridge. the point i that, a i said a little early - i do not know whether he was in hi place at the time - the consequence of the arrangement i that we have undersized constituency in the wirral and oversized constituency in some part on the other side of the riv. ye, and my right hon friend may not have realised it, but i am actual support hi argument. the point i am make i that a public inquiry i able to examine any problem that are thrown up a a result of that, and that i why i am support hi amend 15, which would create the circumstance in which public inquiry could still be held. it i very tempt to be taken down the road that my hon friend seek to lead me, but have spent a lifetime struggle with the problem of the mersey i am hard likely to spend what remain of my life struggle with the problem of the solent. he make hi point effective. my key point i that there are practical imply to such change. they need to be examine and the b way to do that i in a public inquiry. the hon member for epping forest, for whom i have some affection - she referred to socrates, so perhaps at this point i should say that it i entire platonic - outline the argument that this issue i not important and that a lot of these inquiry were vexatious and just held for the benefit of political party. i do not think that i true. my experience of have sat through two public inquiry to major constituency boundary change i that people from the community - people from community group or individual - come along, express their opine and either it i taken to account or it i not. if there i a valid objection, it will often be taken to account. if it i not, it will not. the point i that they are the most important people in that inquiry. it i important to them with whom they are link in a parliamentary constituency. i come back to the point that my right hon friend the member for toot was make: of course there need to be fair on the size of constituency, but if we reach the point where they are pure mathematical entity and if everybody change - if it i like a roundabout, where someone jump on at one point and jump off at the next election, find themselves represent an entire different constituency - the relationship between the constituency, the member of parliament and the people whom that member of parliament represent will change dramatically. not on will those constituency be a mathematical entity, but member of this house will start to view them in that light. that will dramatically change the relationship with our constituent. then i real do want to finish this speech. my hon friend i quite right. the ripple effect in a metropolitan county such a merseyside, which i describe early, would go right through the country. my hon friend put that argument very well indeed and i would struggle to find the word to match what she ha just said. let me conclude. i genuine believe that what i pose by taking away public inquiry a part of the process i that the relationship between constituent, member of parliament and constituency, which i already fracture, will split complete. i think we will end up in a situate where constituency are simply ship of convenience. i hope that that day never come and that the govern will at some point wake up and realise that this i not the right way to do the. the deputy lead of the house make a fair point that those register were out of date. doe he believe it i of equal concern that 3.5 million people will not be register by the time the new constituency boundary are drawn up?",1,0.438,0.229,0.999

834,"new clause 4 i an enable clause, which give the treasury power to specify low rate of duty on fuel sold in remote rural area. accept the new clause would allow discussion to begin; we could then decide exact where line should be drawn, and what the differential should be. i urge the house to accept the new clause. it doe not commit the govern to anything and it would not reduce the treasury venue, but it would allow a bate to start. the sad fact i that fuel i sold in remote rural area at a much high price than in urban area. people live in area where there i no public transport alternate must pay far more for their fuel than those live in area where there i such an alternate. let me g some example from my constituency to show how large the differential can be. the difference between the cost of fuel on the island of mull and islay and in, say, glasgow i usual between 15p and 20p p litre. in the case of small island such a coll and colonsay, the difference i about 30p p litre. that demonstrate the mass extra amount that people live on the island must pay for their fuel. the additional cost ha a damage effect on the economy of those island: not on doe it have an impact on people daily live, but it discourage people from start or continue to run business. the remote community in the highland and island have suffer year of population decline, which show no sign of stopping. the high fuel price are part of the problem: a i have said, they discourage people from open and running business that create the job that will allow young people to remain in those remote community. encourage people to stay in the remote part of britain benefit the whole country. every time the govern pose the build of t of thousand of new house in the sou - east, member of parliament from that part of the country object. they should ask why market force are push people toward it. the answer i that the cost of live in remote area i becoming so great that the job are not there. sustain viable economic community in remote part of the country i beneficial to the country a a whole. there i an environmental justify for high fuel tax: that they encourage people to use public transport alternative. that environmental justify, however, doe not exist in remote area where there are no bus, and where it would be environmental nonsensical for council to subsidise bus service because bus would run with on one passenger on board. there i simply no environmental argument in favour of high fuel tax in rural area. clear, inverness would not be a beneficiary. when my hon friend the member for inverness, nairn, badenoch and strathspey made the proposal, he was talk about nairn, badenoch and strathspey rather than about inverness. road price i, i believe, the long - term solute to the problem. we can fix charge for use road in different part of the country. for example, my constituent on the isle of mull have justifiable cause for complaint when they pay the same tax on fuel and pay more tax to the treasury because of the high rate of vat. they pay more tax in order to drive on pothole single - track road. it i scandalous that they have to pay more to travel on those road than other pay to travel on well maintain motorway. although road price i the long - term solute, new clause 4 provide the answer during the interim period before road price i introduce. the office of fair trade and other organisations, council, enterprise company and so for have carry out investigate to find out why fuel price are so high in remote area. the general reason that always emerge i low turnover. it i argue that tesco and asda sometime sell fuel at a loss in order to encourage people to their supermarket to buy bar of chocolate and milk at inflate price, but a small shop or fill state in a remote village or on an island doe not have that option. there i a low turnover, but the fix cost are the same, so the high price result from that. the on way of bring price down i by reduce the element of taxation, which explain why we are pose new clause 4 today. a we have heard from other member, eu country such a greece, portugal and france have introduce a similar measure and have obvious found a way of make it work. i see absolute no reason why it cannot be made to work in britain a well. if we accept the new clause, it would allow the treasury to do some analysis and some arithmetic, to publish consultation document and to provide impact analysis, which would allow u to decide exact where the line on the map should be drawn. i would certain include all the scottish island. the hon gentleman make a very good point. island have to pay vehicle excise duty, fuel tax and vat. indeed, if my constituent want to take their car to the mainland, they have to pay a high fare to caledonian macbrayne, so the hon gentleman ha made a valid point. to sum up, i urge the govern to accept new clause 4, which would allow study and further analysis to be carry out. the govern could late t the order on which we could vote, allow the burden of fuel duty on remote and island community to be lower. i would certain include all the scottish island in the definition of a remote area. more tail study ha to be done in order to establish exact where to draw the line on the mainland. urgent action i require. we have had century of population decline, and unless drastic step are taken i am afraid that that will continue.",1,0.149,0.209,0.971

read it over the weekend certain form my understand of the matte. however, this i not a satisfactory way to proceed. we have also heard about the concerns of the clerk of the house. they were articulate strong by the hon and learn member for torridge and w devon. i shall not attempt, given my humble background, to denigrate the view of the clerk of the house, but he ha strong held view, and a counter - view was put forward by the chairman of the select committee. all those view need to be fully examine, and we need to see a balance between different witness putt forward their case. i do not, however, share the view that the bill should not proceed a a consequence of those concerns, and i welcome the principle behind it, and the common ground that i to be found across the chamber. one specific matte still concerns me, however, although i was assure by my right hon friend the deputy prime minister comment on it early. it i the position in scotland, wale and northern ireland. the prime minister ha talk about pursue these matte further, and there are legitimate concerns about the prospect of national assembly election in wale on the same day a the next general election for this parliament. the consequence might be an crease turnout, but there i a genuine fear, articulate by many party in wale, scotland and, no doubt, northern ireland a well that welsh, scottish and northern irish issue - the issue of the celtic nation - will be drown out in a national picture. i understand the hon gentleman point, but i hesitate to agree because we are talk about national election for country - about two general election happen simultaneous in the same country. that i the difference. we are talk about the relationship between the media and the campaign and the ability of the welsh and other celtic nation to get their message across in the national media. that i the bate that need to be had. i took the deputy prime minister state a the open gambit in that discussion. i think that the hon gentleman i right. for the first minister in the welsh text simply to tamp with the date and have a general election in wale a month aft a general election would be complete unacceptable. we would have two months of perpetual campaign and the drown out of welsh, scottish and northern irish issue would still very much apply. my hon friend make a tell point. it i one the to have a general election and a one - issue referendum. i do not mind say that i have chosen my line on that issue; my right hon friend the deputy prime minister ha convince me that the welsh people are perfect equipped to differentiate between one issue on one ballot paper and vote in a welsh general election. however, have two general election on the same day i quite another the, not least because of the different boundary that are likely to apply, a my hon friend suggest. that will lead to a huge amount of fusion. we need to take a few minute to reflect on it; i know it i hard for member represent english constituency to understand. it would be immense fuse to voter if two general election were held on the same day. we already have difficulty in explain the devolution settlement and how it work, and indeed explain the distinction between power for the devolve nation and power exercise by this parliament. it i a very big issue. i did not necessarily expect my right hon friend the deputy prime minister to address this issue, but i am very please that he ha. we do not know what it involve - - yet. he ha acknowledge the problem, however, and i pay tribute to him for that, but we have to go further. that might well be the consequence. i would personal much welcome the welsh first minister, rather than a minister in this place, have the capacity to alter the election date, because that i what devolution i all about. the right hon lady make a fair point. that i why i diff slight from the hon member for perth and north perthshire when it come to whether it should be months or year. at the moment, there i a capacity to alter the date for a month either side of the current arrangement, whereas i would welcome an arrange whereby the welsh first minister could effect a difference of months. i am grateful to my hon friend for make that point. i am draw a distinction between a general election and a referendum. fight two general election on different boundary will potential create huge problem. i have never doubt the intelligence of the electorate of ceredigion to make judgment on all sort of the, but some of the concern i legitimate. nobody ha written to me - unlike the right hon member for knowsley, i believe - about fix - term parliament, but i guarantee that people outside poll state will be very concern if we have these two election on the same day. there will be a lot of concern and anxiety about it. it might not have manifest itself yet, but it will if the two election go ahead on the same day. i agree absolute. a ever, i am grateful to my hon friend, who i a committed devolutionist, a am i, my party and other party in the house. it i on right that that decision should be made in the devolve national body. that i a bate to be had, a the past f minute have illustrate perfect. that reinforce the point made by the select committee chairman, the hon member for nottingham north, about the extent of the scrutiny he i able to undertake. the case for pre - legislate scrutiny now seem lamentably to have passe this bill by. these are immense constitutional issue, but i believe that there i a large - albeit not unanimous - consensus about them. i on wish we had the opportunity to illustrate it through the scrutiny work of the select committee and other body of the house.",1,0.433,0.495,0

i want to make some construct comment, and i hope that the minister will take on board some of the issue i raise. i will ask some question from a northern ireland perspective, because the house benefit change will affect u a well - we cannot divorce ourselves or walk away from them. i should set the scene, because northern ireland ha some very particular circumstance: the department for social develop ha responsibility for social security benefit, and the department for employ and learn ha responsibility for train and employ programmes, in contrast with the re of the unite kingdom and the department for work and pension. del ha significant differences with it step to work programme, a against the job guarantee fund here. there are issue to be clarify, therefore, and i want to ensure that the change in benefit will not impact adverse on the people of northern ireland. northern ireland ha had the local house allowance since 2008, but it ha not been formal assess. i had hop that it would be, because it would have given u an idea of how successful it ha been. i am concern, however, that the pose change to the allowance lack a firm evidential base. will the minister com on that? i think that the proposal will adverse affect recipient in northern ireland. i am grave concern about the budget plan to reduce the initial award of the benefit by 10 % in april 2013 to those claimant who have been receive jobseeker's allowance for longer than 12 months. i make that com because the employment rate in northern ireland between april and june was 6. 6 %. worse still, the work - age employ rate remain well below the uk average, and was the low of all the 12 uk region. the change put forward tonight will adverse affect the people of northern ireland because of our position in relate to benefit. i have concerns about the introduction of a measure that utilises sanction that are neither helpful nor beneficial. the proposal appear to be base on the assumption that a reduction in house benefit will motivate work - age claimant to find work, but it i clear that even if every work - age claimant was so motivate, there would still be significant numb of long - term unemployed people in northern ireland beyond 2013. perhaps the minister will com on that. we have to find a balance. how do we distinguish between those who are genuine seek employ and those who perhaps are not? i mention early that the focus of house benefit ha to be on provide low - come family with access to good - quality house. the house benefit cap rate may have a knock - on effect on the social house sector, a private rent accommodate become hard to access for those on low come and the demand for social house crease. a great many people are in a catch - 22 situate: they do not have enough money to rent a house private, yet there i not enough social house for them. i thank my hon friend for hi information, which i helpful in focus attention on what we are try to aim for. member have mention fuel poverty. one of the spin - offs of lose house benefit will be fuel poverty. in my former position, i sat a a member of the northern ireland assembly. one of the inquiry that we undertook was on child poverty. fuel poverty and house benefit both came up in that inquiry to child poverty, but all those the were part of the jigsaw of how people survive. take away one part of it and we have a problem. i have some concern about that. one member mention the discretionary house pay, and i would certain be keen to find out from the minister what he tend to do if the pool of fund that i set aside run out. he said that it was impossible to separate house benefit from house and social develop policy in general, and there are some example of that in northern ireland where house ha been design to bring mix community together, such a in loughbrickland in county down and ballynafeigh in sou belfast, which are also example of how we have move forward. i would like to express some concern over the removal of house benefit from people where it will drive them toward poor area. for some people who are already in poor area, they will not move beyond them, and i have concerns about that. i am conscious of the time, but another concern of mine relate to apply by car for disable people - i do not think that the issue ha been mention fully yet, although some member may have partial touch on it. a car for a disable person might want to apply, but the on person who can do so i the claimant spouse or partner. would it not be more beneficial to ensure that the re of the family member, who are perhaps those who are more affect, may also apply? i look forward to hear the minister response to that. i also believe that some considerate need to be given to single parent who have share custody of children. i am not sure whether that issue ha been address, so i would ask the minister to look at that, too. where custody i establish, benefit entitlement should be grant to the parent to support the family it. i do not believe that the proposal do that. again, i ask the minister to consider that point. other member have touch on the issue of large family. it would not apply so much in the area that i represent, but i believe that it none the less apply right across the unite kingdom. ha particular considerate been given to ethnic family in other part of the unite kingdom, where large, multi - generational household are perhaps more common?

"" we run the risk of rehears bate that we had before on secret quest. the start point i that an quest i not tend to prove something beyond all reason doubt. public interest immunity apply to quest, subject to judicial view by either side, and the govern can persuade the coroner to withhold sensitive material, a happen and was upheld in the jordan and mccann case, for example. my right hon friend ha already mention gisting. such restriction are compatible, in principle, with an article 2 compliant inquiry. my concern i that what i bee pose i a secret inquiry at the behest of the execute. a i have indicate, there are other option. we simply do not know enough about the rodney case to answer that question; that i part of the problem. i think my right hon friend i putt a false prospectus before the house in this respect. my main concern i to ensure that there i an article 2 compliant investigate. i have given indicate of how that can be achieve in these circumstance; it may well be that there are other way round it. the hon and learn member for beaconsfield ha given my right hon friend a way forward by say that if the amendment in lieu are accept, the bill could go back to the lord with some assurance to try to deal with some of these problem. this system ha operate before, in northern ireland. british irish right watch ha written to member to say: "" we have monitor the use of the inquiry act in northern ireland and have found it lack in it ability to deliver truth and justice to the bereave, build confidence in the rule of law and to comp with the uk's human right obligate. "" so this may not just be a one - off, because it ha happen before in northern ireland on several occasion, and it ha been shown not to have work in term of provide article 2 compliance and build confidence in the rule of law. my hon friend know far more about northern ireland than i do, and i would certain pray in aid hi intervention in my argument. that i a real fear. my right hon friend right said that the de menezes case was dealt with under the quest procedure. that i because there was no other way of deal with it. if these arrangement had been avail, perhaps the de menezes case might not have seen the light of day in the same way - similar with the dyson case, which dealt with deplete uranium victim from the first gulf war, or the mubarak case, where the govern resist tooth and nail proper inquiry to the death of that young man in feltham young offend institute. my right hon friend make hi point. the rodney case was a police operate to try to bust a drug gang. it was a very dangerous gang by the sound of it - firearm were involve - but it was not an issue of national security in term of intercept evidence. given the way that the bill i current phrase, there will be secret inquiry at the behest of the execute. the execute will set the term of reference, the minister will choose the judge, the minister or the judge can restrict attendance at the quest, the minister or the judge can restrict the closure or publication of evidence or document, the minister can redact port and commendation at the end of the inquiry, and the minister can suspend the inquiry mere on the ground that it i in the public interest to do so. that i far more broad and generous to the secretary of state and to minister than the original sup - quest proposal were. that i why i am worry that there are no safeguard in the bill that deal with this issue. similar, if the quest i resume aft the inquiry, the find of the quest are not allow to be consistent with the outcome of the public inquiry, even if the jury come to that conclusion. so if a judge i conduct a public inquiry and the quest i late resume at the behest of the coroner, the jury i not allow to make a certain find even if that i where the fact take it. secret quest are bee place by the prospect of secret inquiry, which will not be adequate and effect investigate. they will not be dependent or provide public scrutiny, and they will not involve the next of kin in the way that they should. in the 16th port of the joint committee on human right, we particular consider the use of the 2005 act and came to the conclusion that "" any inquiry act 2005 inquiry specifically design to circumvent an quest, in order to meet the government concerns about closure of sensitive information would raise the same or similar issue a clause 11 - 12 "" - the quest vision - "" about the dependence and effective of that inquiry for the purpose of article 2 "". the current proposal will not g closure to relative or create public confidence that lesson have been learn. are family expect to take serious a secret inquiry chair find a to what happen to their love one? it i sometime difficult enough under the exist open arrange to convince them that justice ha been done. are the public expect to accept the find of a secret inquiry? we have seen the action that there ha been to recent inquiry - the public have simply said that they have been whitewash. that would happen particular if port were redact and the family and pubic exclude from hear or from seeing documentary or other evidence. the secret inquiry will cover exact the sort of case that should be held in the open - those in which the state i potential implicate and dependence i essential. amend in lieu i a sequential amend to allow for the suspense of a normal inquiry, for example to a big rail accident, in which there will be none of the imply that i have mention. the proposal in the bill cannot be allow to become part of our law. we have to provide a proper, article 2 compliant process for relative and the public. with the leave of the house, i would like to move amend in lieu.",1,0.184,0.308,0.998

- new - found ardent support - - for partick thistle. i apologise to my hon friend the member for dundee, east because i miss the open of hi speech, but he made a strong commitment, a did hi predecessor in the house, to the modernisation of the house and it practice, and i pay tribute to that. the hon member for witney made a very witty, powerful contribute to the bate. i am sure that he was please to bring to an end the brief period in which witney was represent by the labour party, although when he start to talk about the levellers i wonder whether he might be planning to follow hi predecessor and cross the floor. i suspect that that might not happen. i congratulate all three maid speak. today bate ha focus most on programming, but i was struck by the fact that two conservative member said that they had never participate in a deferred division and tend never to sign what they term the visitors' book. i was worry that if that became a trend throughout the conservative party, labour's already large majority would become large still. in the interest of democracy, i encourage other conservative member to participate in deferred division. we heard some pretty synthetic anger about the use of deferred division. the hon member for tiverton and honiton seem to be concern that our constituent might cover the time of a vote and lobby u about how we should vote. i do not imagine that any of u would have a problem with that. if a deferred division i on a matte that give rise to strength of opine in a constituency, sure it i part of the proper democratic process that people can participate. the right hon member for bromley and chislehurst suggest that deferring division meant that member would be less form when participate in vote. if anything, a deferred division enable a member to be more form. a member who was not present for the bate ha the time to study hansard. it i not reason to suggest, therefore, that people who do not participate in bate are any less well form than those who vote in the traditional way at the end of a bate. the mote give more right to stand committee, a was grudging acknowledge by the hon member for beaconsfield, when he said that it could be a great improve. that will be the test in the come year a we experiment with the proposal. the govern will still t a programme mote on second read, to set an out date from committee and the overall allocate of time for remain stage. the mote will, for the first time, g the stand committee power to make it own proposal to amend either the out date or the allocate of time for remain stage. moreover, the mote oblige the govern to t a mote to g effect to the stand committee proposal, which will be taken forthwith, or, if the proposal are reject, to have a bate on the floor of the house. if the proposal i that there should be more time in stand committee, the mote cannot be delay and must be table within f sitting day. that will enable the stand committee and the house to vary an out date and the time for remain stage in the light of the committee sitting. it give the initiate to the stand committee, a the modernisation committee conclude that it member are b place to undertake programming. we have look at the experience of the previous session and have try to learn from it. that i what the modernisation committee port seek to do and the proposal tonight would implement that. i shall attempt, albeit briefly, to respond to some of the other contribute. the hon member for tiverton and honiton quote a letter from the previous lead of the house and was concern that programming doe not ensure that all part of the bill are scrutinised. clear, one of the major purpose of programming i to ensure that that scrutiny happen through all the stage of the bill. the letter receive from my right hon friend i evidence of h good faith. she stress the power that opposite party should have through the process and she try to view how it was work in practice. if the opposite do not engage with the process, there i little that can be done. that i why the modernisation committee ha view the proposal to create great flexibility. if there i good will and hon member on both side of the house participate, we may be able to have more effect scrutiny a a result of the change. it i clear incumbent on all hon member, include minister, to comp with the letter and the spirit of the change. that i important because they are a much about the culture a about the rule of the house and any sessional order with which we deal. i shall move on to try to address some of the other point made by right hon and hon member. my hon friend the member for stoke - on - trent, central said that, although programming was accept, compensate change should be made. a i have said, the aim of programming i not to reduce scrutiny. my hon friend made some important point about pre - legislate scrutiny, but the change should not be seen in isolate. pre - legislate scrutiny ha already taken place, and we have the opportunity to extend it with the legislate that will be introduce in this parliament. hon. member should view the change a a package, rather than simply consider each of them in isolate. i agree with my hon friend that we need to consider far more pre - legislate scrutiny. the hon member for aldridge - brownhills, who serve a a member of the modernisation committee throughout the previous parliament, made a point, a he did in a previous bate, about the numb of guillotine mote during the previous parliament compare to the period when baroness thatch was prime minister. i understand that he arrive at hi figure for the numb of bill guillotine by add guillotine mote to programme mote. i entire respect the fact that he doe not agree with programming; that i the point of this bate, but programming ha wide support in the house. if guillotine are consider separate from programme mote, the hon gentleman will find that hi point doe not arise. the hon member for buckingham made a point about the programming sub - committee not meet in public and the lack of avail transcript. i understand that all the formal proceed of the committee are minute, but that it i not the practice to publish the minute. that i the point that the hon gentleman make, but it i not a decision for the govern. the sub - committee are constitute a select committee. they are deliberate committee, and mr. speak ha rule that they sit in private. that ha advantage, because a more consensual approach can be establish to ensure that the concerns of opposite and govern member, a well a those of front benchers, are include, but such issue can be view and are open for bate a the process of modernisation and form of the house continue. the hon member for sou staffordshire, to whom i apologise because i was not in the chamber to hear all hi speech, made an important contribute. he made the suggestion, among other, that the modernisation committee could be constitute a an "" improve of scrutiny committee "". clear, that i one of the many suggestion that can be consider a matte progress. of course, the procedure committee and the liaison committee, both of which are chair by back benchers, serve a powerful advocate for change and improve in the practice of the house. the most posit way forward i to achieve the b possible co - operate between those committee and the modernisation committee during this parliament. if hon member will excuse me, i shall draw my speech to a close by referring more general to the background to the bate. several member have referred to the role of member of parliament. sometime the impression given i that labour member are sup social worker and that opposite member simply want to scrutinise legislate. that suggestion i deep unfair; all hon member seek to do our b not on in represent our constituent but in scrutinising legislate and the govern. the proposal are experimental and are base on a view of how the previous proposal work in the previous session. if they do not work, we can view and consider them in a year time. a ha been said, there was support from all party in the modernisation committee. the former member for east devon, sir pet emery, support the proposal, a did labour and liberal democrat member who serve on that committee. many hon member have talk about the low turnout at the recent election and the connection between people and politic. the yah -

"" we were told by h majesty govern not so long ago that they had to agree to the judgment of the court and that the minimum they could do was to limit this right to prison sentence to four year or less. the consequence of that are absolute appall. there are 28,770 prison serve sentence of less than four year: 5,900 for violence against the person, 1,753 for sexual offences, 2,500 for robbery, more than 4,000 for burglary, and almost 4,500 for drug offences. my constituent in kettering do not want those people to have the right to vote. the legal industry ha reach a new low in tout for busy among convict felon whereby lawyer will try to get fee for themselves by prosecute h majesty govern. that i appall, and it make the whole issue even more sickening. the hon gentleman take a perfect reason position. i total agree with him, but he i a principle man and he make an important point. the bottom line for me i that there would be less shame in leave the european convention on human right than in give prison the vote. he may agree with that, but it i the line that i would take. what people do in other country i up to them. i would like to stay in the convention, but we are deal with a court that ha gone wrong. it i clear not function proper. it ha a backlog of t of thousand of resolved case. many of it so - call judge have no legal train at all; they are probably less qualify than me to make judgment on these the. how ha it come about that we, in a sovereign parliament, have let these decisions be taken by a kangaroo court in strasbourg, the judgment of which do not enjoy the respect of our constituent? i am most grateful for that very helpful intervention. those judge in the european court should reflect on the fact that there would be no human right in europe today were it not for the fact that this country stood alone against a tyrannical regime in the second world war. it i on because this country was prepare to take on the might of nazi germany that there i a european court. we have to decide in the chamber today whether we are go to draw this line across which the court shall not pass, and we need from govern front benchers some gut and backbone to take it on. i have been very appoint indeed by the stance of h majesty govern since the general election. i know that they want european issue to go away and do not want to trouble the electorate with them, but frank, the advice we have been given by h majesty govern ha not been good enough. there i no way in which they will get the four - year rule through this chamber in legislate. in opposite, we were told by the attorney - general: "" the govern must allow a parliamentary bate which give mps the opportunity to insist on retain our exist practise that convict prison can't vote.

indeed, the previous conservative govern said this repeated - that the british crime survey i a more liable estimate. the home secretary ha not mention one crucial factor about the 1980s: output began rise from the end of 1980, but the recovery was so slow that employment did not fall until 1986. can he predict what the effect on crime would be if that were to happen again under a conservative govern? i welcome this opportunity to cuss the proposal put forward in this year gracious speech. my hon friend have already point out that the loyal address i little more than an opportunity for electioneer, and the govern have admitted a much themselves. much of the legislate stand little, if any, chance of make it on to the statute book, and i head inexorably toward the wash - up and a soapy consensus. that i not necessarily a bad the at this stage of a parliament, but we have seen it all before, too often. there i to be yet another criminal justice bill - the 28th, on our count, since 1997 - which throw together an essentially random selection of measure a diverse a the dna database, about which we have just heard in some tail from the home secretary, domestic violence, gang junction, antisocial behaviour, wheel - clamping, mobile phone in prison, and air weapon. this i legislate by grapeshot. never mind the quality, feel the width. astonishing, the pose crime and security bill will amend an act that receive royal assent on 13 day ago. that i swift revision even by the government lix standard. i do not know what the bill team at the home office have been up to, but they are clear work overtime. in all this helter - skelter activity, and with the home office play all the symptom of attention deficit order, where i the strategy? what are the govern try to do? are minister mere indulge in inane activity, like a hamster on a treadmill? i see in this frenetic energy no guide purpose and no sense of direction. our criminal justice system i cry out for an approach base on the evidence of what work, yet, once again, we have a bill that claim populist objective, regardless, in many case, of the evidence and bereft of strategy. the evidence suggest that prison should be for serious offend and serial offences, not an everyday response to low - level thieve and other minor crime. yet, look at the big picture, we desperate need a shift from prison to other, more effect measure to stop reoffending. the reoffending rate for young men on their first prison sentence i 92 p cent. prison are just college of crime, where the young learn better the technique that we would rather they did not learn at all. i do not accept the hon member's point. in fact, in many case, there i not an adequate grade response to criminal or antisocial behaviour, particular among young people. i tend to turn to that point late. prison are full of drug addict, who should be treat elsewhere, and people with mental heal problem whose circumstance are likely to be aggravate by their prison experience. adopt a problem - centred approach to crime, in which we actual did what work to cut crime, would do far more to prevent crime and to detect criminal so that they could be caught. that would provide a far great deterrent than just bee even tough on the tiny minority of criminal whose case end up in a court conviction. if we take to account the british crime survey figure and those for busy crime, plus those for people under the age cord by the bcs, probably on one in 100 case end up in a court conviction. people are therefore likely to be impress by posture on tough punishment. in fact, so small i the probability of bee caught that it would make precious little difference if we were to promise far tough punishment. that i why we need a new approach, with a much great emphasis on detection. we also need more prevention, involve easy measure such a improve outside light, alarm and window lock. we need more detection, to ensure that criminal face justice. the prevention aspect of that agenda alone provide the main reason why crime ha fall further and fast in liberal democrat - controlled council area than in either labour or tory - controlled area - the home secretary laughs, but, given that hi own city of hull and many other major city outside london are now under outright liberal democrat control, we are no longer make our point base on a small sample. i am astonish that the home secretary think that free school meal are relevant to crime figure. let me g him a practical example of what i am say. i have visit a numb of liberal democrat council - a no doubt he ha; perhaps he should visit more - to see what work they are do on the prevention agenda. let u take liverpool a an example. there, the liberal democrat council ha stall alley gate, which have the enormous merit of prevent burglar from popping to backyard and steal the from people home. i am not say that alley gate i the on factor, but that, along with police, ha had a dramatic effect. since it peak, crime in liberal democrat council area ha fall by more than the national average, at 20 p cent. before we get any chortle from conservative member, i should say that, on crime, conservative area have perform less well than the national average, with rate fall 16 p cent. since the peak. let u look at violent crime: down 6 p cent. in conservative area, but down by more than twice a much - by 14 p cent. - in liberal democrat - council area. we are talk not about small sample, but about quite substantial area, and what matte i what work. we need a big, strategic shift from prison to police and probate, because catch more people who commit crime i a great deterrent than more harsh punish the few whom we do catch. i am grateful for that intervention, because my hon friend i absolute right to draw attention to the pilot in derbyshire, where the result are encourage and, indeed, the reoffending rate are a he scribe. however, i agree with the home secretary that it i important to have more police on the front line - if on the govern would take hi apparent advice. we need a further 10,000 police office on the front line. we are still under - policed when compare with other lead industrial democracy, but we need better police, too. one of the biggest appointment of the gracious speech and the crime and security bill i that they represent yet another miss opportunity by the govern to show some real commitment to police form. the national police improve agency should be given a wide remit so that it can commission search to any measure that cut crime, include not on better police method, but measure outside the police. chief office should have great discrete to manage their force, decide key staff change and ward specialism. the police tract - lifetime employ, now for 35 year, a single point of entry and pay link to seniority rather than to talent or effort - should be urgent view, a success port from inspector of constabulary have point out. it was right to make a bonfire of the central target and control that have been introduce since 2002, but it was sure wrong for the home office not to cut back on the data requirement and re tape that went with that central control regime. it was sure wrong, too, to fail to put in place strong local governance arrangement to pick up where whitehall's meddle left off. chief office must be responsible for operate, they must be dependent and they must be operational dependent, but strategy and priority must be determine by strong and representative police authority that speak for their people throughout the force area. there should be better consultation at local, basic command it or operational command it level, because that matte; but the real locus of accountability i where the money i decide, at police authority level, and on more powerful accountability will drive up police standard toward the b. detection rate, even for violent crime, vary from 34 p cent. in the worst perform force, the metropolitan police, to 67 p cent. in the b perform force in england and wale. that i not an accept variate, and the public should not accept it. however, the govern have run away from the bate at the first whiff of gunshot from their own, labour, councillors, and the official opposite have pose a system that make strong men blench. one elect sheriff, in a multi - ethnic and diverse area such a great manchester or the w midland, would be a aster, a the sheriff would be elect while ignore the vast majority of hi or h voter. that way lie insensitive police, random stop - and - search and the brixton riot. without such form, the measure herald in the gracious speech are just tinker around the edge. we need strong local governance, but it ha to be right and it ha to be representative. even where the govern are face inexorably with the need for form because of court judgment, they manage to botch their response. let u look at the dna database. of course, dna should be use in criminal investigate. no one deny that; and it will go on bee use. forensic should be better support than ministers' reorganisation of the service suggest. however, the government proposal - a six - year period hold dna even of innocent people - i still an extraordinary response to the european court of human right and to the age - old principle of british justice that we are innocent until prov guilty. just under 1 million innocent people - i think that the chairman of the home affair committee, who i not in hi place, said that the figure i 750,000, but my information from a parliamentary answer of 15 october i that it i 986,000 - now have their dna on the database, yet 2.3 million people who were convict before dna was routine collect do not have their dna on the database. no wonder the effective of the database i steadily fall. liberal democrat favour instead a simple rule: if someone i convict, their dna will remain on the database; if they are innocent, it will not. by contrast, the government illiberal proposal i likely to be struck down again by the european court, a it i not a proportionate response to a problem, and it still intrude on the right to privacy guard in the european convention on human right. the home secretary will have notice that at our party conference - i note that we are a party that determine these the democratically - we vote very firm for the view that innocence and guilt should be the determine criterion for whether someone i on the database. that ha the great merit of simplicity and of bee understood in line with our tradition in this country. a the hon gentleman know, the scottish system was introduce while the liberal democrat were in govern in scotland, and we were very happy with it. in fact, there i very little difference between the system that i have suggest and the scottish system. a a matte of clarity, it would make the much simple if we apply the simple rule of innocence versus guilt. the labour government adequate proposal on the dna database are entire typical of their approach to crime and civil liberty. minister have ignore the evidence of what real work to cut crime, but they have still manage to trample civil liberty underfoot. it i shock, for example, that on one in f hospital i provide the anonymised data that allow police to target violent hotspots and cut woundings by 40 p cent. in the case of cardiff, that i clear shown not in anecdotal evidence of the sort that the home secretary gave u on the dna database, but in pee - view, solid academic evidence of the type that he fortunate prove rather too dismissive of in respect of the advisory council on the misuse of drug. the reality i that minister repeated come here with proposal that scythe away at the right to test, the right to know how people have die at the hand of the state, the right to jury trial, the right to express oneself in a public place, the right to know what one i charge with when detain for up to 28 day, and the right to leave one own home if a minister decide otherwise in a control order. rare ha so much that i so precious been sacrifice so enthusiastically on the altar of effective. that death of civil liberty by a thousand small cut i precise why liberal democrat have put forward a coherent and comprehensive bill for peal intrusion to hard - won freedom. it i call the freedom bill. it pose a reduction in the period of detente without charge from 28 day to 14 day. it advocate the abolition of the illiberal and credit control order regime - which, accord to a recent front - page article in the daily telegraph, the conservative oppose. i was surprise to see that, given that whenever the measure ha been up for annual renewal they have repeated fuse to join u in the lobby to show their opposite. our draft bill also advocate negotiate the balance u - uk extradite treaty, with particular relevance to the current case of gary mckinnon, who suffer from asperger's syndrome; scrapping the illiberal and expensive identity card scheme; and roll back the surveillance state by curb the use of the regulate of investigatory power act 2000, rather than move the check on police use of that act, a the conservative pose. on by putt together the cumulative loss of freedom can we dramatise the effect of this govern since 1997, and indeed of the last conservative administrate. the freedom bill i a key priority for u. i turn to the strong power to tackle antisocial behaviour that have been suggest. it i a real and press problem across the country, a we all know from our constituency. it can blight people live to live near or next to a family from hell. we will examine in tail the measure that the govern have brought forward in the crime and security bill, and we will deal with them on their merit. again, however, the strategy i far from clear. we would instead introduce new community justice panel and posit behaviour order and crease the use of accept behaviour tract, while serve antisocial behaviour order a a last sort. there i a real problem with asbos at present, because they are honoured most in the breach. they are not use a a last sort, and they are not enforce proper. in response to the hon member for monmouth, who mention custody, asbos should be part of a graduate response to a problem rather than something that we go to ear in the process, which mere bring them to disrepute. we would also pilot a you volunteer force, to make engagement with the community more attract to young people and to bridge the divide between young and old people. activities could include the restoration of sport facility or environmental project, provide people with skill for the future. i turn to immigrate, which was an important feature of the mark of the hon member for epsom and ewell in particular. the govern have squander opportunity upon opportunity to form what i a broken system. the draft immigrate bill i the ninth immigrate bill since 1997. if they were go to simplify the system all along, why have they use eight act to make it so complicate that the long - awaited and much laud simplify bill i now on ready to be publish in draft? their ability to tackle the issue involve simply beggar belief. the bate on immigrate should be base on the evidence of benefit to this country, not on scaremonger about british job for british worker or on whipping up yet more anti - immigrate rhetoric. the abolition of exit check by the conservative govern, follow up by the labour govern, mean that we still have no idea how many people are in this country illegal. near 2 million short - term visa are issue every year to student and other, but we still cannot check whether they have been respect by seeing whether the people who have been issue with them have left the country, a the uk border agency i still on able to check 60 p cent. of exit from this country. the liberal democrat would immediate instate exit check, so that we could at least grasp the extent of the problem and ensure that short - term visa were respect. we would create a new national border force with police power, so that our border were proper controlled. i did not hear anything from the conservative bench, or indeed the labour bench, about the benefit of legal migration. with a quarter of the doctor and half the nurse in london have been born oversea, the nhs would collapse without migrant worker. migration must be able to respond to the diverse need of different region and industry, and a blunt cap on immigrate of the sort pose by the conservative - without any numb attach to it, we note - would frank be a soviet - style response from a dynamic market economy such a that of the uk. would we real fuse to allow manchester city to sign robinho at the transfer window because a cap had been reach, or fuse to allow some city of london firm to hire someone who could help create job for british people by bring a skill that was not already avail to u? that i just simple populism, not sensible policy. north of the border in scotland, even conservative want more migration and a large population. in the sou - east of england, by contrast, we are talk of desalinate plant to provide fresh water, which clear show that we are reach the environmental limit of population density, because such plant quire fossil fuel to heat the water to evaporate the salt. the liberal democrat would ensure that immigrate work in the interest of the uk by create a regional point - base immigrate system, give great weight to skill and region that need migrant and less to those that do not. the hon gentleman real must stop play hi ignorance of matte within hi portfolio. if he had actual spent any time study system that are base on the point - base system that we apparent copy, he would know that they operate in australia and canada. what happen i that a visa i issue that apply to a particular geographical area. the hon gentleman may be aware that 192 million people come in and go out of this country every year and that the most effect way of controlling illegal immigrate i through employer. the system i very simple. a they do in australia and canada, we ensure that an employer ha the visa paper of an employee. if they do not entitle that employee to work in that region, that i illegal immigrate just a much a not have a visa at all. the system i very simple and it work. he could tell me that people will live in southampton and work in edinburgh, but that i high likely. the main point i that the visa apply to the workplace, which i -

why do they need to extend this parliament for an extra year? some element of the coalition govern are in a lifeboat, wait for the general election of 2015 - a political equivalent of the carpathia - to come by and lift them out of the sea in which they find themselves. that i the on reason for pose a f - year term. it i preposterous to introduce a f - year element to a well establish cycle of election every four year. it i almost like the olympics: if we can divide the year by two, then it should be an election year. every other democracy that we have highlight today ha gone down the road of four year - in the case of the american senate, the division i by two. we have a well establish political infrastructure in this country. i thorough agree with my hon friend. we now have a different kind of govern. had the numb been slight different, we might have been in a similar position - that i, in a coalition. however, i cannot imagine that one of our first bill would have been to extend the life of that parliament and put a statutory limit - not a flexible limit - on the length of our term, although some of my colleague have ask why we did not think of the idea first, when we had a majority of 164 in 1997. hindsight i a great the. a for the length of parliament, i want to off my hon friend the member for rhondda an apology, because he was right when he said that there were three parliament that ran in excess of f year. there were three other - i have just add up the year; i did not have the benefit of the chart - that effective ran for f year. however, i hope that he will accept that, taken together, it ha been usual to go beyond four year. there ha been a strong element of honesty - certain from this side of the committee - about what happen in the fifth year of a govern. we have to be realistic about the dynamism and energy of a govern in their fifth year. i member come to the house in 1997 and hear then opposite member - some of whom are now member of the govern - say that the fifth year of any parliament i often the one in which the govern are tire and running out of steam. you might member hear similar comment, miss begg. i do not think that create fix parliament of f year will change that dynamic of politic. four year i the time it take a govern to put a programme in place and to deal with the major issue that it came to power to deal with. another element, which i find tasteful, i that this govern are seek to extend their own life. i would have more respect for this legislate if it extend the life of the next parliament. at no time did either of the political party that now form the govern say that they would extend the life of this govern by an extra year. there i a distinct difference between the flexibility in the constitute now, and a law that say that this parliament cannot, without jump over various hurdle and achieve various percentage, call a general election before the end of that statutory period. that i the fundamental divide in the committee. i turn to the practical point of whether we should have general election at the same time a other element of our democratic society have their election. the integrity of other element of our democratic infrastructure should be protect. frank, the westminster attitude that everyone else should change i not compelling, and i insult to the t of thousand of people who are involve in all sort of political activity at local govern level, and indeed at assembly and parliamentary level. this parliament establish the assemblies and devolve parliament. we should keep faith with them and recognise that they have the right to pursue their own democratic mandate without our overlay our election by statute and no longer a a matte of flexibility or choice. hold those election on the same day will cause major difficulty, even if that occur every so many year. we are cuss different system for not just two of those element, but for three or four. we could have the alternate vote system if in the referendum, whenever it i held, the people accept it for this parliament. we have first past the post for the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly, and over and above that, a my hon friend the member for rhondda said, a third and yet another system i the regional list vote. the issue i not that the people of the various country of the unite kingdom may be able to discern the different political argument that might be made; complexity will be add to our democracy when we want to encourage more people to be involve in democracy. we are in dang of putt them off by say, "" this i how you must vote in this election, this i the way on that election, and this i the way on the second vote. "" on a practical point, we may pass legislate in the house, but it ha to be implement. let u imagine the difficulty that turn office will face in the first and subsequent election when they conflict with those element of our electoral system. we are ask turn office and all the staff who make sure that our democracy work to do almost the impossible. although there have been bate on why 140,000 ballot paper were spoil at the last scottish parliament election, it i fair to say that the response from turn office and their staff was that hold different election on the same day with complex vote system did not help matte, albeit that there were issue with the ballot paper. what worry me particular about the how the legislate ha been introduce i that when challenge the deputy prime minister answer was that the date of the other election should be change. that i arrogant, and underpin the content of the bill and the speed with which it i bee steamroller through the house and the other place. the hon member for aldridge - brownhills argue powerful about constitutional change, and he will recognise that if such change ha to happen, it should do so with consensus throughout the house. constitutional change should happen because all political party recognise the need for it. what we have here i a unilateral decision by a coalition govern who did not highlight f - year term in their manifesto. i may be wrong, but i think that was four year, not f year. trust the liberal to get involve in semantic. everyone else knew what i was talk about. i suggest to the minister that there i general good will in the house for fix - term parliament, fix - term election, or whatever phraseology we want to use to scribe what we all know we are talk about. there i consensus on that principle, but the govern must decide whether they will list to the voice not just of political opponent, but of people who want that constitutional change. it i not a long way to travel to recognise major constitutional and practical problem with the date that they have chosen, and with the f - year term in principle. a coalition i also about listen to people outside the coalition, and i hope that the govern will yet come forward with a change to the bill so that the house can agree on fix - term election in a way that allow u all to move forward without make it an issue of acrimony between party. in a radio programme that i heard on friday, a lead member of the liberal democrat party in the scottish parliament said that in no circumstance would the liberal democrat introduce tuition fee. ha my hon friend any idea how we could duct a bate about tuition fee - given the position of one of the partner in the coalition govern, the liberal democrat party - while also try to duct a bate about fund for student in scotland, with all that happen at the same time a the two election? my hon friend i make a powerful argument on the practical issue. ha she also had time to consider how the broadcast authority will maintain some element of balance, a they will have to schedule programmes for two different election with two different political dynamics - with different party bee in different position in different part of the country? are we not place an impossible burden on those whom we are ask to implement the legislate current go through the house?",1,0.349,0.313,1
