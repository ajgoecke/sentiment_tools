3,"Jane Yolen has a quote that sums up my feelings about this book perfectly:  ""You may adore Love You Forever, but I hear it as a story about an overbearing and smothering mother who infantilizes her son and can only tell him she loves him when he is fast asleep. I also contend that she drugs his cocoa.

4,"First of all, the illustrations are hideous. Just stare at that cover for a while. Really take it in.  This review hits the things that bugged me the most about this book, especially the way the financial difficulties associated with paying for college were waved off.  But more than those issues, this book just reeks of fakeness. This isn't a true story. This is a pop therapist's thought experiment. It's about as substantial as cotton candy, and I think kids will notice that.  Want a real book about a kid overcoming significant challenges to work in conservation? Read A Boy and a Jaguar and talk with your kid about how Alan Rabinowitz didn't let his stutter stop him from pursuing his interests. Or read Wangari's Trees of Peace: A True Story from Africa and talk about how Wangari Maathai started with a small dream and ended up changing the world.

Pixar refused to lower their standards of quality in the second and third Toy Story films, too, earning the respect of many who are used to mediocre film sequels.  This little book serves a very nice purpose. It gives us another experience with a set of characters that America has come to love, gleaning from them an additional smile or two in connection with the Christmas season. That's what this book is; simply an unambitious Christmas story for those who are fond of the Toy Story movies. I like that idea.",1,0.388,0.5,0.952

As you can see, with all those unanswered questions, I was pretty antsy and excited to read this. "" Then, why did you give it one star?"", you ask, confused. Here's your answer. I actually only truly read to page 18. I looked ahead and saw that there was Charissa had a crush on Parm. Well, Charissa and Parm? They're both girls. The lesbian issue was not portrayed as unbibical, instead, it was portrayed as perfectly fine! I am just really uncomfortable reading about that- already!- in a book, and frankly, I don't think the author should have included it. The reason for the one star review?

13,"Ah, Christian fiction. I knew people were often not on board with this book, finding it to not be kosher, if you will (had to), but I didn't know why until I picked it up. It's kind of a shame that this book is a super Christian message about the maker and not just a lesson learning story or a cultural teaching story. It's really a shame because Mitchell Heinze's artwork has a real texture to it that I liked. I wish that people wouldn't bulldoze their faith around and would instead try to just tell a story and include elements of their culture in that story. I read a children's book written for the same age level about a month ago. A big plot point was the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah, and I wasn't offended in the least. That story taught me something. This story was just an anecdotal overview about the Christian god and why he needs to be followed, and I didn't enjoy the preaching in the least.

15,"This is like reading the Bible except I didn't find the Bible (at least the parts that I've read) dragging.  It's a bit disturbing for a children's book, isn't it? I mean, a girl willingly strayed from her mother to go to a pilgrimage with an angel to see the Child-Christ in the manger ... and the angel let that happen why? Actually, the girl ran after the lamb because she wanted to stroke its soft fleece and she told the angel that and the angel just said, hey whatever you're coming with us. Dear angel, what very important part did that little girl play in the birth of Jesus Christ for you to have her tag along and not just return her to her mother like how you saved the drowning guy somewhere in the story? In the Bible, parents were known to be told to sacrifice their children to prove their faith to God (at least the petty, vindictive, old testament god) but at least they know what will happen to their child if their child disappears. Elisabet's mother was tormented for 50 years not knowing what happened to her little girl. Okay, let's not blame the angel because towards the end it was said she was abducted by people during the war ... yes let's make this a political thing as if it's not confusing to begin with. And then in the end the book still implied that the pilgrimage was what really happened so ... yeah. Psychological roller coaster? Anyone?  Is this a book I'd read to children? Eesh.",1,-0.059,0.333,0.724
16,"This book was just silly. Even for a Goosebumps book - and that's saying a lot.  Evan, the main character, is a FLIPPIN' MORON. Really, really, deeply stupid. I mean, I couldn't even believe how stupid the character was.  He tells everyone in his school about Monster Blood. What it did (turned his dog gigantic when he ate some) and insisting that it's real. Yeah, that's going to make you a lot of new friends at your new school, bub. What an idiot.  And there's a bully that always picks on Evan. One of his favorite tricks is offering Evan his hand to shake while apologizing, and then crushing Evan's hand into pulp. Evan NEVER learns. He ALWAYS takes the proffered hand. The bully uses this trick on Evan three times in the course of the book. THREE TIMES.  In another scene, the bully uncharacteristically apologizes for punching Evan and offers Evan a free punch. ""Go on. Hit me as hard as I can. I won't hit back."" Even a 4-year-old could tell you that this is a trap and a stupid idea. But Evan does it. Of course, a teacher is watching and Evan's the one who gets in trouble. He's an idiot.  Luckily, Evan's non-girlfriend (I mean, come on, they're 12) Andrea aka Andy shows up. She is about 50x smarter, stronger, braver, and more able to kick ass than Evan. And Evan never fails to act like a total jackass with her. I have no idea what she sees in this kid. But at least she offers the reader some relief from the onslaught of stupidity.  But the plot is stupid also. A hamster eating Monster Blood and turning giant? A hamster. Seriously??!!? And the ending of the Monster Blood suddenly reversing it's effects because ""today is it's expiration date"" was beyond lame.  Tons of fat-shaming in the book. I mean, the teacher (who's a jerk) is obese. We get it. You can stop the endless references to waddling, multiple chins, and calling him fat. We got it the first 30 times. Jeez.

Yellow and Pink, each a kind of humanoid being, come up with their own theories about how they might have been formed. Pink says that they obviously must have been created by someone, while Yellow figures that they probably came about by some kind of accident. The issue is never really resolved, leaving the reader to wonder what the truth is about how Yellow and Pink came into existence, and what their story says about our own world.

30,"Arthur's grandfather has gone missing four years ago. Arthur lives with his grandmother, mostly happy, except for wishing his parents would stop their job-hunting to come live with him again. As an evil plot emerges to take away his grandmother's land, he turns to the Minimoys, a tiny people inches tall, to warn them of the impending disaster and seek the rubies he suspects must be hidden with them.  This was a disorienting read. Arthur is supposed to be ten, but he often feels younger than that as he's careening around playing with his toys. That wouldn't be a problem, though. The bigger problem is that the plot seems determined to give a ten-year-old boy a plot better suited to a young adult novel.  He falls in love with a girl based on looking at her picture. This attitude doesn't change despite the fact that she's an enormous jerk to him the ONE DAY they are together---he's head over heels for her. Then he ends up in a bar getting drunk, depressed because she went and danced with someone else. But when she's threatened, his heroism rises up and he battles hordes of henchmen . . .  . . . Yeah.  The crazy pocketknife Betameche has is about the only saving grace. Some of the madcap actually works, especially when he's involved. But the plot's very jerky even when it isn't swinging into way-too-old territory (and did I mention there's a scene with Arthur's grandmother flirting with a police officer? Not what you'd exactly expect out of Grandma, honestly).  In short, this is a waste of time. For a good action novel featuring very tiny people, try something like Puddlejumpers by Mark Jean.

The brown-skinned people in turbans are all portrayed as dirty and scheming and bent on intentionally serving the wrong god, whom they know to be evil but serve anyway. Granted, this is probably how Lewis would have described actual Muslims and Persians and Arabs and Indians (not that he would distinguish between any such groups), but it's disturbing to see it so acceptably allowed in a book ostensibly for children.

The blatant racism (imagine Calvin and Hobbes, with the Taco Bell chihuahua as Calvin, and without the intellectual weight and transcendent art) would be enough to sink it, and the incredibly retrograde sexism/gender stereotyping, and the groaningly cutesy-pootsy prose and verse are just superfluous reasons to despise Skippyjon Jones.

I sided with the parent/step-parent combo. I don't think it has to do with me getting old, either. But someone needs to smack some sense into this kid. Please.  * Still no such thing as an albino horse. Sorry, but genetics is a bitch that way.  * No resolution to the basic problems presented.

62,"Originally posted at http://www.audiobookfans.com  My Review: I expected to really get a kick out of this audiobook. After all, I myself am a father of two boys (4 1/2 and 13 months). For the last 13 months of my life I have only on the rarest of occasions ever gotten more than 3 hours of consecutive sleep. My nights are inevitably interrupted when the baby monitor starts screaming in my ear and I get up and try to coax my son back to sleep. Usually this requires a bottle or two and about 30-45 minutes of patience.  So I can totally relate with the utter exhaustion many parents feel and I thought that this book would be a balm for my frayed nerves. I was wrong.  My expectations going into this book were that there would be two conversations going on. One conversation would be between the parent and the child. This conversation would be one where the father is gently trying to get the child back to sleep. Either reading a book, humming a song, or whatever. The second conversation I expected would be an internal dialogue of expletives that would parade through the father's head but never actually be voiced and directed at the child.  Unfortunately there does not appear to be two conversations in Go the F--k to Sleep. Lines like ""F__K your stuffed bear, I ain't getting you shit"" and ""Hell no you can't go to the bathroom! You know where you can go? The f__k to sleep!"" are voiced directly at the child. Ultimately this is the problem I have with the book. I can't imagine ever saying anything like this to my kids and it really bothers me to think about other kids out there in the world who are treated this way.  In Samuel Jackson's introduction to the audiobook he talks about raising his daughter ""I did say 'Go the Fuck to sleep' to her a lot."" How cute.  In my opinion, Go the F--k to Sleep trivializes emotional and verbal abuse and promotes an agressive and dysfunctional style of parenting. From watching the traffic on the #GotheFtoSleep I get the distinct impression that my thoughts are in the minority. That's ok. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Most seem to think this is harmless fun and I sincerely hope they are right.  I get it. I understand why people may think this is funny.. but I can't find it humorous in this context.  For all of the fans of this book it appears you will have something to look forward to. With all the attention that this book is garnering I'm expecting we will probably see more ""F--k"" books from Mr. Mansbach. We can probably look forward to such titles as:  Eat Your F--king Breakfast  Put On Your F--king Shoes  What the F--k Do You Want  Clean Your F--king Room  Don't Hit Your F--king Brother  Won't that be nice?",1,-0.131,0.125,0.854

There are continuity errors (for example: what happened to the other 5 ponies bought with Misty's Twilight's dam?)

Misty's Twilight is to represent wild creatures (How?) even though she'd never spent one day as a wild equine. From what I gather online, Misty's Twilight spent the rest of her days quietly in a pasture after having three foals.

67,"Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/  Did I really just give a children's book a 1 Star rating. Yep. Am I sorry?  The blurb told me Hissy Fitz would be a ""humorous tale about a cat that makes Grumpy Cat seem cheerful."" It was not. I decided to pick up some ARCs of children's books because I'm always on the hunt for stories that I can recommend/purchase for friends or ones that my youngest child might enjoy. Sadly, I found the tale of one day of Hissy Fitz's life to be dull and I have a hard time imagining what kind of magical child would be able to finish this book without complaints of boredom.  Hissy Fitz just wants to get some sleep, but instead he spends his day avoiding the excessive snuggling of his young female owner and being tormented by her younger brother. Not only do these humans not know when to leave a guy alone, but they aren't aware of the rules when it comes to petting, food and water distribution, and appropriate noise levels either. Based on the synopsis, I had my hopes set on something much more similar to the hilarious  Sad Cat Diary  and this story just didn't deliver.  I also had a bit of a problem with the 100% undisciplined hellion brother (""time outs aren't allowed"" - seriously parents? and you wonder why your kid is a butthole!) and the fact that Hissy Fitz was an indoor/outdoor cat who lived in a city with acknowledged dangers such as busy streets, traffic, and enemies such as the evil raccoon. I'll refrain from getting on a soapbox regarding the whole indoor/outdoor cat debate further. There could have been a small chance for redemption if the artwork would have been good, but sadly the artwork was not provided. Note to authors/publishers: It's hard to review an ARC that isn't complete.  I'm bummed that this one missed the mark, 'cause I luuuuurv me some kittehs.

The fact that there are no repercussions for the obnoxious sister (Holly) also sends a bad message to kids: it's perfectly ok to make fun of someone for getting things wrong, making mistakes, struggling with reading, etc.  Then there's the textbook clueless parents (unseen in this book) who, completely unaware that they've raised the kind of daughter willing to tease her younger brother in front of her friend, ask her to tutor him in spelling, where she proceeds to yell at him and humiliate him further. Picture it if the gender roles were reversed: would we be ok with a book series where the older brother taunts and humiliates his younger sister for not being very good at math? Really?

Or when her mother try to convince Matilda that you have to choose between looks or books, basically that being smart isn't useful and not something to strive for, when her father explain to his kids how much of a crook he is and how proud he is about it. Or just the way her parents completely abandon her at the end, as if to say to kids, well if you don't like your parents you should go stay with someone else.

Alberto seems to be a self-insert of Jostein (Never will I want to meet him.) and I'm beginning to believe Jostein read a few chapters of a philosophy book and thought, 'Hey, I can do this too.'

Really, Jostein play Sophie's mom as stupid and uninformed.  Sophie is bland as hell. It's like Jostein had no knowledge of teenaged people - she took everything he said as truth and slowly started growing an ego the size of Jupiter; she started ditching her friend Joanna due to her oh so sudden feel of being 'above' the subjects which her friend spoke about, spoke off to her mother with her nose very far in the air and...

The uncle is supposed to be trying to save the penguins, but he send them in small crates and overwhelms a single house with 365 penguins. The thin environmental message is overshadowed by the fact that the penguins are not living a good life in their new, foreign environment--they get stuffed in filing cabinets and cubbies.  Teaches addition, multiplication, cubes, and shapes with the answers upside down on the page.  The orange, black and white illustrations are simplistic and reminiscent of older picture books before revolutions in printing capabilities came about.",1,0.095,0.143,-0.793
117,"** spoiler alert **  If I recall correctly, the first book states that the children we placed with Olaf because remaining in the city was important for their well-being, and stopped from staying with Justice Strouss because the parents' will requested the children be cared for by family. This book stuck with the familial relations, but back in the city seems unlikely because Olaf seemed like a last-resort at the time. Okay, sure, the 'orphans are in' thing but that seems super flimsy as why would children go to someone who refused them the first go around and would be jut as apt to cease the orphans' care?  Regarding the audio, it is better than previous books, but the 'dear reader' was not rewritten for 'listener', which is not important but is an easy thing to point to so as to demonstrate how none of the book audios have even gotten close to the amazing production of the first. Also, Jerome has a Nigel Thornberry voice.  As far as the story itself, I found it beyond my capacity for disbelief.  For instance, it is stated it took about 3 hours to get down the elevator, and if one assumes the same time the second decent (lower because of experience, higher because one-handed) and at least as much to go up (likely quite a bit more) -> twice, and the time the pokers were in the oven, the time is at least 12 hours, more likely 14 or more. Yes, the book does acknowledge that they were at it all night, but they are still done before morning and this is ignoring the time spent talking, waiting for the guardians to go to bed, gathering materials, and tying the rope.  More traditional stories sometimes have a need for something to happen and force it without much foundation; in a story based on everything going wrong there is an awful lot that goes right far too simply. No, not just things like perfect knots and a chore for each of the children's specialties, but the fact that the catalog for the auction was put in the library was beyond my ability to ignore as it was too convenient and did not fit the way the Justice (who's presence also took part in the unfortunate events) had law books, the Monty had snake and location books, or Josephine has grammar books - all of those fit a character but leaving the catalog? That belongs in the auction house, or to be used . . . it is just one example, but overall the things the characters need have moved toward too convenient too often and are beyond my ability to accept in the fictional story world.  For three too-smart children, I cannot believe not one of them thought 'last time we told the triplets later it didn't work, maybe we should hear them out because that will help us help them later if we do not get back in time'.  Tooth-climbing was . . . so far beyond plausible. Two older children who always have creative ideas and cutting a corner of the net so as to swing down was behind tooth-climbing as a solution? WTF? They could have even had Sunny chew the rope to do it, although pulling out a peg would have been enough.",1,0.082,0.149,0.992
118,"** spoiler alert **  Owen  Kevin Henkes  Greenwillow  1993  Caldecott Honor  This review is also on Get Kids to Read: http://www.mrtierneyslibrary.com  This review has spoilers.  Owen is the story of a young mouse trying to hold on to his childhood. His neighbor Mrs.Tweezers is nosy and tells his parents he is getting too old for his blanket. She convinces them to try several cruel tricks to get Owen to give up his blanket until his mother gets an idea that is absolutely cruel she cuts up his precious blanket into handkerchiefs.  I have never liked this book, while Kevin Henkes is a very talented writer, and I enjoy most of his other mouse books, Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse being among my favorites by Henkes, I find the entire concept cruel. Children will outgrow their childhood things and change but they must be allowed to change and grow at their own pace.  While the idea for the handkerchiefs is a creative way to allow him to continue to have his blanket with him, I cringe at the part where the blanket is torn apart.  I find it unrealistic that he could want to take his blanket everywhere one minute and be fine watching his mother take scissors and cut it into pieces.

Probably not.  I'm a little mad, I'm not going to lie. I feel like I've been lied to. Clearly, I expected this book to be about a little best man attending a gay marriage, and maybe the events surrounding the main one, but in the eighty pages I did read - and this book is quite short - there was no reference to that.  Archer is lovely, don't get me wrong, but he's very reserved, even with the reader. He just loves describing other people and things that are happening around him. So much that sometimes I would forget the book is written in the first person POV.  Eighty pages in and I felt like I knew nothing about Archer.  Plus when this new, interesting character makes his way into the storyline, the realisticity of the book dissolves. I mean, I get that it's a small town and the gentleman is very handsome, but the reactions of the media, teachers and classmates seemed quite exaggerated.  There's no other way to say this. It's a forgettable book. Archer himself is entirely forgettable. He's the kind of shy, sweet boy who's in your class, and yet, you never seem to notice him, because he doesn't want to be noticed.

125,"Meh. Tedious.  I really thought I would enjoy a book about the railways, and I did enjoy that aspect of it. It's funny how quaint and informal the railway officials are but it was nice to see the children's growing love for the railway station, the trains and the employees working there.  The plot, as it goes, was boring. The childrens' father was imprisoned for spying but the mother does not tell the children anything and lets them speculate all manner of terrible things, which I found to be quite cruel. The eldest finds out about it by accident and the mother makes her promise not to tell anyone. These are not small kids but almost teenagers. The family doesn't seem to make visits to the father in prison either. It was just made out to be a big mystery, but I found it all rather forced. The book does not go into details about the arrest and so on, which could have made it more interesting. The mother kept yapping that now they are very poor but there was no struggle shown on the part of the children to try to adjust to their new surroundings. I also don't think Mother knows what poverty really is.  There were some sub-plots, but most of them were senseless, especially one involving a famous Russian writer who appears to get stranded in a remote village of all the places! It didn't lead anywhere either and seemed very forced. There was one good plot involving the station master, though, which I thought was rather nicely done. Bobby's final moment of intuition was forced and unrealistic too.  The three children are all saccharine sweet and boring beyond belief. Peter is the one who was a little interesting but I could not really sustain interest in the squabbles that ended almost as soon as he started them, because diabetes-Bobbie apologises right away all the time. Phyllis is almost a background character, and does not have any separate plot of her own. Roberta is the eldest and is a goody two shoes who consistently got on my nerves with her diabetes-inducing behaviour. The last concern with children that age is trying to act good, but Roberta is not a teen, she is a robot. One who bursts into tears all the time. Maybe this was Nesbit's ideal teen, rather than a real one. The siblings go around doing good deeds all over the place, which frankly is rather boring.  We also learn a scientific fact in this book meant for children - something that has been read and absorbed by kids for about a century now. Girls are weaker and softer because it's good for the babies. Yes, so weak and soft that they can push out big babies from a small hole ... Very good for them, I'm sure, if women are unable to handle pain. Very soft, indeed! It's SCIENCE, don't you know?!  I am not sure I would have enjoyed this book even as a child. Reading this as an adult, it's perfectly tedious and I hate all of them. Everyone is really fake, the plots are either boring or don't really fit in together, and the scientific facts are not supported by peer reviews. Total loss!

131,"What do I like about this new Madeline book written and illustrated by John Bemelmans Marciano? (Marciano is the grandson of Ludwig Bemelmans, the author of the original Madeline books.)  Well, I like the title; it's evocative and promises a good story. I like the cover. It is the most successful of Marciano's attempts to reproduce his grandfather's artistic style. And I have to give him points for his meticulous preparation. According to an AP article,  ""Marciano meticulously practiced Ludwig's line techniques, tracking down which pen nibs he preferred. First, Marciano blew up drawings from some of Ludwig's originals and sketched them in pencil, then placed clear velum on top and worked in pen and ink over and over again.  ""'I went over his lines less for the style than actually wanting to learn what his literal strokes were,"" he said. ""How long they were. I was almost meditating over what he did. When I was ready to actually do the book I threw all that stuff away and just kind of went with it.'""  But however well Marciano has captured the mechanics of his predecessor's style, I think that there is still a tad less life in his artwork, perhaps because it is so studied.  Where the book really fails is in the text. Rhymed narrative is extremely hard to do, and Marciano's is just lame. The original Madeline books were never very easy to read aloud because of the way the text scans, but a skilled reader, with care, can pull off a smooth reading. I would never want to read aloud Madeline and the Cats of Rome. Marciano's syntax is annoying, his rhythm limps, and many of his rhymes are a real stretch. I am definitely not buying this for the granddaughters even though they are big fans of the original Madeline.",1,0.126,0.524,0.898

Why isn't that a possibility? Instead we are railroaded into the idea that a field must stay a field. How the hell would anyone get anywhere if all the fields stayed as fields. It's nice that this one man had his house to live in, but now he's all NiMBY and wants to prevent anyone else from having the same kind of opportunity that he had.  So then, when he is still short of the purchase price of the field, apparently he trespasses and illegally plants pumpkins there. So...his strongly held belief of what he wants is more important than obeying the law. And then (after some odd fantasy intervenes), he earns enough money through this illegal venture to buy the field legally. And then he doesn't plant more pumpkins. He leaves it an empty unproductive field. What children ought to learn is that this bozo should have been arrested and thrown in jail.

134,"As the endgame draws near for this incarnation of the Horrorland series, one would expect Jonathan Chiller's involvement in the plot to be increasing; however, that isn't really the case in The Wizard of Ooze. As with all of the other books in this second tier of the series excepting Weirdo Halloween, Jonathan Chiller only appears at the beginning and the end, deepening the mystery over what he has planned for the kids who have bought merchandise from his Horrorland souvenir shop. The story arc will be reaching its end soon, yet we still know little about the larger scheme that Jonathan Chiller has in mind.  After buying an extremely rare edition of a comic book featuring his favorite supervillain, The Ooze, at Jonathan Chiller's store, Marco can't resist following the directions in the back of the book about how anyone can find his or her own superpowers and become a superhero. The shocking thing for Marco is that the tips actually work; at least, they work for a few seconds, before leaving him back in his natural state again. Marco is sure that he's doing something wrong, but what? If the concept weren't real then it surely wouldn't work even for just a few seconds, but how should he go about procuring the superpowers on a permanent basis?  Unfortunately for Marco, the excitement of being on the cusp of achieving special powers causes him to let his guard down and be less discreet than one should be under such dynamic circumstances. Suddenly there are real supervillains on his tail, desperate to steal his rare comic book. If Marco gets in their way then he's likely to be toast, as there's precious little that an average mortal can do against a being with superpowers. If Marco can get his powers working regularly, though, then maybe there is something that he can do. But how is he to figure out the final piece to the puzzle when it has completely eluded him up to this point?  R.L. Stine rarely fails to install some unexpected twists in his books, and The Wizard of Ooze has its fair share of surprises. I would rate it at one and a half stars, for sure, and I almost rounded that up to two.

However Donald causes problems by mocking her (and getting turned into a watermelon) and then stealing her broomstick and then realising that riding a witch's broomstick is not all that easy (especially if the witch puts a spell on the stick to discourage thieves).

Each member has a role throughout the story; Tommy uses his searching and digging skills to find clues, Calder uses his pentominoes (small letter-shaped tools used by mathematicians) to sort out ideas, and Petra uses the copy of The Invisible Man she finds to help guide her thoughts. One might think that saving a house from ruin would be a safe little endeavor; however, The Wright 3 find themselves in dangerous situations both on their own and as a group more than once. Someone...or something...doesn't want this house demolished!  The Wright 3 is a sequel to the book Chasing Vermeer, but you don't have to read that first to understand this book. And the illustrations of the house by Brett Helquist are great! The three kids risk a lot to save the Robie House...would you do the same?",1,0.029,-0.143,0.83

Instead we got an almost Oliver Twist scenario with Billy, and some literal freak show. The only thing I liked about the book was the social and political commentary of The Daily Scourge.  Also, if Joan and Bob were that desperate for a child, why not adopt from the orphanage? Instead they decided to instantly fall in love with a child who didn't show them love once, who constantly misbehaved, got into trouble, made people actively dislike them, ruined their home, nearly ruined their businesses, and only said sorry because he learned when the words were meant to be said.

Only she can get them to do what they need to do, leading them to streams to drink and sheltering them from dangerous weather and other hazards of the land. The Girl loves the horses, and they, in turn, trust and love her.  When The Girl and her family's horses become hopelessly lost one night during a severe lightning storm, they meet up with a beautiful, wild stallion, and The Girl wordlessly agrees to give up her regular life to merge her horses with those of the stallion and all live together as one wild herd. Even a year later, when the girl is finally located by her family and brought back home, she finds that she no longer is happy living within the confines of human civilization. She must live among the wild horses, where her destiny can freely unfold and she can find the life that she was always meant to lead.

238,"Sometimes it seems as if Jack Gantos has an unending well of story ideas from his days as a kid. He takes actual experiences from the first twelve years or so of his life and mixes in just enough fiction to make for stories that are hilarious to readers of any age and reading level. Dead End in Norvelt, winner of the 2012 John Newbery Medal, may be his most famous example of this, but Jack Gantos had started with that form of storytelling long before his Newbery Medal winner was ever published. In 1994, Heads or Tails: Stories from the Sixth Grade launched the popular new character of Jack Henry, through whom Jack Gantos could live his memorable childhood days again (albeit in somewhat invented fashion) and give his readers a taste of what it was like to be a kid decades earlier. Life in the 1970s (which was actually about ten years after Jack Gantos, himself, was in sixth grade) wasn't a whole lot different from life in the '90s, as it turned out, and Jack Henry proved to be nearly as popular and enduring a character as Gantos's classic picture-book cat, Rotten Ralph.  Heads or Tails is about Jack, his older sister Betsy, five-year-old brother Pete, and mother and father living in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, scrimping and saving and trying to stay afloat with never a break in the financial crises that keep on coming their way. Jack doesn't demand much; for the most part, all he really wants is to have peace with his parents and for his friends to like him, to keep Pete and himself out of major trouble and have some fun along the way. He knows that his parents can't afford to buy him all of the things he wants, but he's learned to adapt to that reality, as do most kids who come from households of modest means. Jack's father has difficulty holding down a job for very long, and so his family has moved five times in the past six years, heading to wherever it is next that promises solid employment, even though it never seems to work out over the long haul. Despite the transitory nature of his life, however, Jack is able to come up with a few new friends wherever he goes, and we see some of his Ft. Lauderdale friends in the adventures of this book. From the outside, Jack may appear not to be especially good at dealing with change, but he always lands on his feet, coping with whatever new storms enter his life and being willing to rebuild on the other side of them. For Jack, contentment hinges on his ability to get back up after being knocked down and adapt to changes as they arrive.  Besides Jack, I think that my favorite character in Heads or Tails has to be his younger brother, Pete, who appears as a main character in a few of the stories. Pete is smart, and knows how to use what minor leverage he has to get what he wants, but he's also sensitive to what's happening to the people around him, quick to break into tears if he thinks that some calamity has befallen Jack or any of the rest of the family. Pete often follows Jack's lead, which lands him in some bad situations in Heads or Tails, and it's this reality that eventually causes Jack to reevaluate the choices that he makes in his own life. If the bad decisions that he makes aren't only going to affect himself, but Pete also, usually with more severe consequences for Pete since he isn't as savvy or aware as Jack, then maybe there's something to what his father says about Jack being responsible for Pete's safety. Maybe he really should think about the messages that he's sending his younger brother through every action he takes, wordlessly declaring some things to be all right and others off-limits. It's important business, being a role model, and what he leads Pete into today could have a big impact on his tomorrow, as well as the many tomorrows that follow.  Heads or Tails is sort of a hybrid book, not completely definable as either a collection of short stories or a traditional junior novel. Therefore, it's kind of hard to say which individual stories are the best, since they all run together and refer back to previous happenings on a consistent basis. Still, if I were to highlight just a few of the eight stories in this book as being particularly noteworthy, I'd have to say that My Brother's Finger, Death and Taxes and Cocoa Beach are the three best. If I were to choose a fourth, it might be My Brother's Arm. These chapters strike me as being the most thoughtfully and sensitively written, and I don't think it's a coincidence that two of the four feature Jack's brother, Pete, as a main character. One can see the beginning stages of a future Newbery Medalist developing his novel-writing style in this book, figuring out how to tell stories that are fresh but also have some deeper meaning, humorous while still containing real literary value. I think that Heads or Tails accomplishes this balance well, and makes me eager to delve into the rest of the series and find out what happens with Jack next.  Jack Gantos's books are always very readable, entertaining for all ages and good for generating further conversation between kids about what the stories mean to them. I've become quite a fan of Jack Gantos, and would enthusiastically recommend any of his books that I've ever read. My rating of Heads or Tails is definitely two and a half stars, and I thought for a while about rounding it up to three. I'm confident that most any reader will find something to like about this book.",2,0.244,0.594,0.999

272,"A young girl corresponds with a middle aged philosopher who guides her through history and teaches her western philosophy. Its a very interesting premise and offers substantial summary to many popular philosophical elements. The young girl, Sophie, is an intelligent fourteen year old who reaches out to the philosopher often.  There are couple of things that stood out for me while reading this book which has nothing to do with the philosophical content. Sophie's parents are absent for most part of this book. Her father isn't to be seen though Sophie has high praise for her father. Her mother is around and exercise mild curiosity in her daughter's life but doesn't necessarily get involved. Sophie practically writes her off a boring person who wouldn't understand the conversation she was having with the older man. Sophie's mother doesn't comment on the time Sophie spends with this philosopher in his house. It was unsettling in the way Sophie distances herself from her friend and parents, and seeks him out often. It struck me odd.  This book is definitely a good starting point for a young reader or one who wants to delve into this area. Gaarder touches the subjects superficially, avoids major conflicts and restricts content to what suits his agenda. He never offers Sophie a counter argument to his perspective which I believe is not the right way to educate a child. But then again, Sophie is far too young to be formulating philosophical boundaries with second hand knowledge.  Every few pages, I found myself longingly looking at the final page.

The plot of this story is also exciting because it is centered around a curious mystery that children can relate to, so it will make them want to keep reading to find out what happens next, plus it will also engage their minds as they try to figure out the mystery for themselves.

Lucy is nervous about camp to begin with, even though her grandmother will be nearby working for the neighboring technology camp, and her feelings about the place worsen when she notices her best friend, April, starting to act differently around the other campers. Lucy decides the way to make her mark at camp is to play match-maker - first for her grandmother, who begins dating camp director Mr. Bosserman, and then with her fellow campers. Unfortunately, not everyone wishes to be paired off the way Lucy imagines, and soon she is in a fight with all of her friends old and new. Though I quite liked Pack of Dorks, this sequel is just not as strong. Some of the individual scenes are very tightly constructed and well-written, but the links between them, and the overall plot structure are weak and hard to follow. The characters are also lacking. College-age camp counselor Jessica calls the kids ""camper wampers"" in a way that is just completely unbelievable, while Lucy seems to have no core personality, but rather reacts to things based solely on how they will further the plot. There is also the issue of the characters' ages, which is really confusing. These kids are entering fifth grade, but Lucy describes herself as an almost twelve year old. Unless she was held back in school - a fact never established by the story - there is no way this math works. And whether they are nine or twelve, all of the characters sound like mini-adults, which makes it even harder to figure out the intended audience.

282,"I've read and loved Jacqueline Wilson's books since childhood, and have probably read and thoroughly enjoyed almost everything she has produced (despite being long out of childhood now!). I recently finished her latest novel Clover Moon and thought it was great, proving she has lost none of the ability that she has always been possessed of. However, Love Lessons proves to me to be the most lacking of her work so far.  The story follows Prue, a girl who has previously only ever been homeschooled, as she tries to negotiate life in a tough inner-city high school, and the way she falls for her art teacher. It is a subject matter that is important to discuss, particularly with the age group that this book is intended for, and I applaud any children's or YA author who tackles it. However, the way it is done here is worrying. Jacqueline Wilson seems to have portrayed a highly romanticised version of a student/teacher infatuation, with little to no counterpoint to offer a critical perspective on the matter.  It isn't that her characters or story development are bad; far from it. They show her classic talent for creating fleshed out characters whom the reader really grows to feel for, and the story moves along at an easy pace. My main criticism isn't even the (controversial?) subject matter. It is the way that subject matter is handled, and in particular the way Prue is ultimately treated and judged by those around her.  Yes, it is told from Prue's viewpoint, which, as a 14 year old naive schoolgirl, is completely and understandably one-sided. I can fully accept that from her position, the relationship she and Rax form is romantic, tortured, unfortunate and misunderstood. I think Wilson has captured very well the feelings of a lovelorn 14 year old. But where the book is let down for me is in a lack of a counter to this viewpoint. One way in which this could have been produced is to show Prue and Rax actually eloping together (something not so out of the ordinary, as something similar is often in the papers) and the reaction of the school, her parents, friends etc to this. I think that would have been a very effective way of showing a flipside to Prue's infatuation, without jumping out of character.  My other main criticism of the book is the way in which the adults who are aware of something happening between Prue and Rax, namely the headteacher, react. The headteacher actually blames Prue for the entire relationship, basically insinuating that she led Rax on and used her wicked womanly ways to ensnare him. What a ridiculous load of victim-blaming, sexist nonsense! At the end of the day, Prue is a child and Rax is in a position of authority. However well-written and sympathetic the characters are, and however much the relationship is portrayed as normal, if there is any blame to be placed anywhere here, it should be firmly on Rax's shoulders.  Unfortunately, this could have been a much better, more effective novel. As it is, I think it is dangerously one-sided and lacking because of that.",2,-0.128,-0.064,0.763

291,"The Pomegranate Seeds is an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1853 retelling of the Demeter/Persephone myth (entitled ""Pomegranate Seeds"" in Tanglewood Tales). As one might expect from the adaptation of an adaptation, this tale is quite a muddled version of the classic myth. The actual abduction is extremely downplayed, almost to the point of nonexistence (the word ""kidnapping"" occurs only once in the book, I believe), and Hades is depicted as simply wanting a child to brighten the halls of his dreary underworld palace rather than lusting after a young bride.  On the other hand, Demeter is portrayed as an overbearing, enraged working woman who, rather than losing herself in grief, is determined to exact revenge on the entirety of the world. There is a curious addition of a ""lizard boy"" who is slightly rude to Demeter and is subsequently transformed into a lizard by the goddess then exacts his revenge later by convincing Persephone to eat the three pomegranate seeds. The myths connection to the origination of the seasons is quickly glossed over at the end of the book.  The biggest failing of the book is the complete misspelling of the guardian of Hell, the three-headed dog Cerberus. He is referred to over and over again as ""Cerebus,"" a significant oversight.  The illustrations of the book were pleasant, warm and dreamy. They are probably the highlight of the book.  Overall, I was quite disappointed with this retelling of the Persephone myth. While I understand the desire to downplay its more frightening aspects, I feel that too much of the myth's core was lost. The book is more text than picture book, lending itself better to solid readers who probably do not need the glossing over of unsightly mythical details.",2,-0.326,-0.143,-0.92

I did not pick the book because she is famous and I did not judge the book because she is famous.  Well, the protagonist is Alexandrea Petrakova Johnson, a 9 y.o that, all of a sudden, is forced to live in Harlem with her mother where she will continue to study ballet ( as her mother wishes), but Aleksandrea doesn't want to be a ballerina, she dreams to be a speed-skater!  To change house, meet new friends, and keep doing what she does not want to do (ballet) is not easy for Aleksandrea, so she desperately wants to come back home. But her mother wants to have a career in New York. She is a stylist and thinks that Broadway needs her talent.  So Aleksandrea keeps to study dance and meanwhile, at the ballet classes, she meets some girls that later will become her friends.  Aleksandrea will learn to live in Harlem and will understand that, with fun and friends, ballet is not that bad.  The book is kinda cute but I think it is written for a very Young audience. It is not deep and nothing particular happens.Just pages and pages of... nothing.  At the end Aleksandrea and her friends skate all together, and she decides to do both ballet and skate and to remain in Harlem where her mother finally found a job thanks to her talent.  It is a nice book that I would reccomend to children of 7 years old. It's written very easily and nothing magical is inside it.

I think everyone can somehow relate this story to their own corner of the world's issues. However, I had a hard time following the broken english.  There are two main characters searching for power: the Lying Line and the Upward Lying Line. We see a lot of side characters, and the story details how these main characters try to help them and their city. But in the end, they are motivated by greed, corruption and power. And as the lowly can rise to power, so can the powerful fall down.  The thought and the story behind the story have a lot of potential to be very powerful. However, I think the grammatical mistakes held me back, and I kind of wished the story had put more depth to the characters. This book has comparisons to Animal Farm, but I think another good comparison would be The Good Earth.  This is something I could see people picking up and reading while waiting to see their dentist or doctor in some type of office. It's a short read and thought-provoking.

Its way more than that! You are not loving that person right, if you think giving all you can is the way to go.  This book gives a completely messed up idea that providing as much as you can until you die is unconditional love. That's loads of bullshit.

The Borrowers survive by taking what they need from the humans whose house they live in. Mrs. May tells Kate the story that her brother told her about a certain family of Borrowers that he became acquainted with as a boy.  My kids liked this one better than I did--the rating reflects my feelings. If it had been up to me we would have stopped about 4 chapters in.  It was okay, just kind of tedious as a read-aloud. A whole lot of dialogue, without very much in the way of setting or character development. It took me a several pages to figure out who was who in the Borrowers family--and there were only 3 of them!  Once you get past all the exposition at the beginning, the actual story part is fine, except that it stops right at a crucial point. Then you have to get through 2 or 3 more chapters of Kate and Mrs. May gabbing about it to find out what really happened. Talk about anti-climatic!  The other thing I didn't like about it was that all the adult humans in the story drank.... and it just kept coming up in the plot--the ""Fine Old Pale Madeira"" this and ""sit down and have a drink with me"" that. In fact there's a whole story about how Great Aunt Sophy in the upstairs bed thinks that Pod (the father Borrower) comes out of her decanter. I didn't bother explaining that one to the kids and they didn't ask.  For this type of story line, I like The Littles series much better. They are much like the Borrowers, except they have tails.

311,"My niece has gotten herself a whole pile of Pigeon books to read, which of course means that they end up in my lap. Although the Pigeon can be possibly one of the easiest things to draw and has been provided with an amazing array of emotions this can also be at times quite overwhelming since of the fact that Pigeon usually comes across as a bad role model so whatever his present desire is and how he achieves it mirrors so much on society.  In this particular book Pigeon wants a puppy. The sensation to me comes across that more or less it is the idea that he is in love with as well as the fact that he is awarded for his begging, whining and tempter tantrum. But what truly gets me is the fact how the story ends since there is no explanation as to what becomes of the main question throughout the story.  The other thing that I didn't like about this particular book is that although it is a Pigeon book it just doesn't read like the other books in the series. It was more of a yep, yep whatever type of read with all its problems and less of a basis for a reader to get a stand on.  Like the other books in the series there is really not much to say about the drawings. Pigeon is easy to draw and if you get the DVD with a collection of his stories the author shows you how to make Pigeon quite easily. What makes the pictures so charming to so many is the amount of emotions that he can show off throughout the pages for it can be a bit creative.

317,"The premise is interesting, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  Basically, Julia witnesses her classmates vanishing from her sight in the middle of class. So she decides to drill down and get to the bottom of what's going on.  An unrealistic premise is perfectly fine, of course, as lots of fun books (i.e. My Teacher is an Alien, Pyrates, How a Weirdo and a Ghost Can Change Your Entire Life) hinge on them and manage to make their story a lot of fun. It's how the premise is handled that changes everything.  For one, a good deal of skepticism would help tremendously and better ground the story in reality. In My Teacher is an Alien, Susan convinced Peter to come with her, as he didn't believe her story. In How a Weirdo and a Ghost Can Change Your Entire Life, Teddy's attempts to convince Martha that he really could communicate with ghosts only made her angry at him until she eventually tried it out herself out of boredom.  Here, Julia tells her friends Lori and Jeff about what happened, and while they think ""huh, I don't remember disappearing"", they agree to help her solve the mystery and even get excited about it. Though Julia later manages to find more definite proof that something strange happened, they believe her from the start. I think they should have only believed her after she gave them the more definite proof, and even then remained skeptical.  Next up, we have convenient coincidences for the sake of plot. Next door to the school is a military base. I won't go into details about how Julia sneaks in, but let's say military security kinda sucks in fictionland.  Things get a lot more interesting once she's inside and discovers the cause of all the troubles. In fact, there's even a really interesting and creative scene that I won't spoil. The story doesn't get any more plausible there, but it lost its believability a long time ago anyway.  It's actually a fun story if you turn off your brain. But I do think the age group it's aimed at should be lowered slightly, and the book renamed ""The Day the Third (or Fourth) Grade Disappeared"". The story wouldn't be any more realistic, but if aimed at younger kids, the sheer amount of implausibility would be easier to overlook.

When this delicate balance is disrupted by unscrupulous men, Ratbridge finds itself headed towards disaster.  Here Be Monsters! takes off running--and promptly trips over its own feet. A convoluted and improbable conglomeration of humor, fairy tale, conspiracy and whimsy, the novel throws so many things into its weird little stew that it's hard to know where to look.

At times, the novel gets so caught up in its own lunacy that you wonder if there's a point to it all.  The revelation of the mystery plans and the trouncing of the villain is so absurd that it's beyond laughter and more likely to raise eyebrows than a chuckle.

342,"While this book might be labeled ""fantasy"", it was written in such a straightforward style and obviously from the mindset of a child that I couldn't really feel any ""magic"" in it. I will admit that Neddie's open-hearted embrace of everything from the beauteous landscape he sees from his train window to a cowboy parade that causes him to miss his train to the La Brea Tar Pits (hilariously redundant in title) to his military classes is great to read. His childish joy sees delights and wonders practically everywhere he looks and that joie de vivre is completely captured by the author.  However, I felt that the supposed end of the world didn't need to be added to this story. The whole plotline felt secondary and tacked on, too vague in its outlines and outcome. The sacred turtle was supposed to be a secret but practically everyone Neddie met already knew about it or wormed the secret out of him with ridiculous ease. The shaman seemed to be both a comic figure and a mystical seer, but he was so poorly rendered that he began to irritate me every time he appeared in the story. He kept accusing Neddie of worrying too much and I was exasperated by his blase air. The boy was supposed to be a designated hero, master a sacred turtle, face a monster of Chtultean proportions and somehow save the world! Of course, he was worried! Who wouldn't be?!

Written for middle school children and older, the plot is simple and straight-forward. We know that the main character, 12-year-old Jamie, has gone through pretty traumatic events, but he keeps his childhood innocence and maintains hope to one day be loved. He is an inspiring little guy, easy to connect with. Topics such as bullying, abuse, and alcohol use are touched on as Jamie's story unfolds, and the author handles them well.  The sentence structure in this book, as well as the vocabulary, lend toward it being used either as a read-aloud or for independent reading in pre-adolescents. I don't see my early teen girls finishing this book because it has a choppy feel to it, and the resolution to the problem is presented in many not-so-subtle ways. To a reader with any experience in mysteries, even a young reader, little Jamie's secretive past probably became clear a few chapters into the book, although Jamie and his caretakers didn't figure it out until the end.  I was confused several times and had to re-read paragraphs, unsure of who was narrating. In one sentence, we are hearing Jamie's thoughts and opinions, and in the next we move right into someone else's, without transition. For example, in chapter 18, Jamie is walked home from the video arcade by Arnold, an older boy who works there, after Jamie vomited playing one of the games. The sisters of the orphanage send Jamie to bed, which he gladly agrees to in order to keep the possibility alive that he can return to the arcade the following day, before the owner removes his favorite video game.  Arnold had already reminded him on the way home that the machine would probably be moved sometime in the early afternoon. The older boy seemed relieved that The Returner would finally be gone. Arnold was becoming more and more perplexed by Jamie's increasingly strange behavior around it.  So we see that Arnold ""seemed relieved"", but then we are instantly looking into Arnold's thoughts, all within the same paragraph. This happened several times and broke the continuity of the story.  Written as a juvenile mystery, the story crossed the line into paranormal and actually gave me the heebie jeebies by the time I'd finished. (SPOILER ALERT) I liked that this boy's birth family never gave up hope of finding their kidnapped child. I even got into the sci-fi idea that Jamie's father built a video game that was able to awaken the child's repressed memories and remind him who he really was. But when all of the rescue and return home turns out to be because of a dead dog's spirit coming back and orchestrating everything, that was too much for me. It would have been easier to swallow if the live dog really had searched all over the country and the dad really was inspired to fulfill his promise to his lost son by building this special video game. Instead, we read the father's explanation of the night he built the video game in chapter 23:  The dog howled all through the night on your birthday, like it was telling me what to do, like it was giving me instructions. I started working that night on The Returner, and I honestly felt possessed, as if something had taken over my body.  And I honestly felt let down. This sweet story of a lost boy, cared for by gracious women in a poor orphanage and ultimately reunited with his family, was converted at the very end into a paranormal ghost story that didn't due the rest of the book justice. I can't imagine that a child who liked the first part of the book would care for the ending, nor that one who was looking for the sort of book it ended up being, would make it through the first 3/4's of the story.  PARENTAL RATING: Though this is not a Christian book, the author portrayed the lovely women of the orphanage as praying women, and his viewpoint on vices such as alcoholism and abuse was appropriate. I wouldn't pass this along to a middle-school aged child, however, because I think the end would scare him a bit, rather than leave him with this warm, fuzzy feeling the author tried to invoke. As always, use your judgement and know your child.  **I received this book from netGalley.com and the publisher, in exchange for my honest review.",2,-0.063,0.213,0.998

347,"Mary Anne and Stacey get to come along on the Pike family vacation because they have eight kids and need help keeping all those kids entertained and well cared for. Unfortunately, Stacey develops a fixation on a lifeguard and leaves all the work to Mary Anne, not realizing that the lifeguard is too old for her and doesn't care about her. She learns a lesson in responsibility and is encouraged through her experiences to make better dating choices in the future.  As a child, I was interested in the different personalities of these girls and enjoyed their hijinks sometimes, but even when I was a less sophisticated reader, their activities often rang shallow for me. This book was a definite example of that, and the problem was exacerbated by the fact that I was not able to relate to ""boy-crazy"" girls. I was confused after reading this because the ""message"" of the story was twofold and I only really agreed with one of the messages. Yes, Stacey, you should not treat a babysitting job while on vacation as a vacation for yourself, thus leaving your co-babysitter with all the work. That I got. But the other message really seemed to be ""that guy was too old for you, so you were wrong to like him."" The ""happy ending"" featured Stacey finding a guy her own age and engaging with him on a similarly superficial level, leading us to believe her lifeguard fling would have been a lot more acceptable as is if they were the same age. Hey Stacey? That guy was exploiting your obsession. He even made you buy him snacks because he knew you would. He was a jerk on purpose. The whole scene where she felt betrayed because he was seen kissing a girl his own age was really weak. He was a jerk way before that.",2,-0.143,0.062,0.619

351,"I was so excited to read this novel, I had heard so many things about it and most of the reviews about it were great yet after I read it, I was disappointed. Let me start off first by saying what I liked about the novel. I liked that it was short and that will appeal to many children who don't like to read. The cover is fantastic too and people will be attracted to the book because of that. I liked the diversity among the children; they each had something to offer to the story and made them unique. What I didn't enjoy was that I didn't think there wasn't any character development in the story; I didn't feel connected to any of the characters. They all were there, existing and I heard them talking and interacting but no one moved me. I also felt like there was no consistency in the book. The scene with the boat went on for pages and pages but yet when they landed on the island, the newness of that and the scene that greeted them didn't get the sparkle, I thought it deserved. As they arrive on land, I thought the children seemed okay with the situation, like they are adults; their maturity level was outstanding for the situation at hand and it surprised me considering everything. Perhaps I analyzed the situation too much, have seen too many reality shows but things just didn't click. I definitely won't be reading anymore of this series.

352,"I really enjoyed David Walliams' The Boy in the Dress. It had a very nice, breezy English flavor, reminiscent of Dahl in its conversational tone.

Dennis is a boy who likes to play soccer but isn't very happy at home because his mother left and his father is hands-off. When he sees a Vogue magazine, he is drawn to the fashions, and he meets a girl on whom he has a crush, and the two start reading magazines together. Then she wants to dress Dennis up in an orange sequined dress and bring him to school masquerading as a French girl. Soon Dennis' cover is blown, and he is not permitted to play in the soccer tournament until local convenience store owner tells Dennis that the principal comes into the store on Saturdays in a dress. Everything ends well, and even the store owner gets to wear a dress in the end. I'm just not sure what the message was. Cross-dressing is okay?

Sneezing? Coughing? Taking a sick day? Don t worry, you'll be feeling better soon thanks to this hilarious picture book from Coy Bowles, guitarist of the Grammy Award winning Zac Brown Band. Full of encouraging and super-silly rhyming advice on how to face sick days with courage and a positive attitude, When You're Feeling Sick is just what the doctor ordered! (Goodreads)  Review:  I liked the idea of When You're Feeling Sick, after all every child is ill at some point and can use a pick-me-up while (s)he is down. I thought this children's book by Coy Bowles would be just the right prescription. Unfortunately, the book falls short for this reader.  First of all, the good. The illustrations are wonderfully bright and attention grabbing. Many ethnicities and abilities are represented so most readers should be able to find someone to whom they can relate. There are plenty of cooties and funny faces to make the littlest readers giggle. The length of the story is also just right, short enough to keep the younger ones engaged yet long enough for the older readers, too.  And, the bad. The prose is sometimes clunky, and the words do not flow well when you read it aloud. Most of the verses rhyme, but not all of them. And when they do not, it is jarring and awkward. Overall, the story is silly, in a good way, but the humor falls flat and the message left me wanting more. Marketed towards ages 3 -7, perhaps the youngest ""readers"" will appreciate When You're Feeling Sick the most.",2,0.05,0.211,0.963
362,"A young Asian girl looks worriedly out the window, then cautiously emerges and sets off down the street. Rain is threatening, as is her gray environment--a barking dog, hunched over man, abandoned house, junkyard--and she walks timidly along. The narrator encourages her to think more positively, ""Scary thoughts are your creation/when you have no information."" She enters a library, her ""shelter from any storm,"" where she is transformed into an absorbed, eager reader, sprawled on the floor, smiling at last in this bright, inviting place. The Morrison's ode to books and imagination has occasionally awkward rhythms in its rhyming text; its coaxing tone ultimately hits the reader over the head with its message-driven couplets. Strickland's detailed watercolors, crayon, and pencil illustrations initially have somber overtones which then give way to soft but bright hues as he pictures what her mind is imagining, even showing her dreamingly reading under a willow tree, although she is actually still inside. His expressive close-up of her face as she explores this world in books could easily be on a reading poster. All her fear and sadness is gone as she walks home in the sun, pulling a wagon of books and smiling at the now friendly pooch and sun-splashed neighborhood. Certainly we want Louise (and all youngsters) to be comfortable in her world, to "" . . . understand what she feels,"" but a more subtle message would have sufficed.

By the sea. On the moor. In the stall. In the bed. In the bed?! Yes, the last few pages shift the story entirely. Readers see a mom reading a bedtime story to a little girl as she snuggles a stuffed horse tightly. The theme of this one from start to finish is that mothers are always dependable and loving.  My thoughts: Yolen has written about five or six very short horse-themed poems. I have nothing to say against their rhythm or rhyme. (I can be picky at times). But the poems are also very repetitive. There really isn't much unique about each poem or each pair. For horse lovers, it may still work. And perhaps even the repetitiveness can be seen as being purposefully lulling.

369,"Brock Cole's illustrations can be quite surprising. While his drawings of people are most definitely simple in form, with movement and facial expressions that rate toward the rudimentary end of the spectrum, his rendering of routine scenery is often splendidly detailed and imaginative. A great example of this is the illustrations on the inside covers of The Money We'll Save, of laundry being hung between apartment fire escapes. This may have been a routine sight for apartment dwellers of the time when the story is set, but Brock Cole's interpretation of the scene hints at a subtle romance behind it all, the energy and quiet warmth of regular families going about their business as usual, leading ordinary lives while trying to stay afloat financially in difficult economic times and loving each other through any situation that might arise. This is where Brock Cole's work has its main impact, the imparting of this feeling of old-fashioned resolve and togetherness, and it's why I liked the story.  Money can be tight for any family with four children, but especially in New York City, and even more so around the Christmas season. When Ma gives Pa careful instructions as to how he should carry out the family's grocery shopping so they'll have enough money left for Christmas dinner, a shrewd merchant sees his chance to convince Pa to purchase a live turkey. After all, what better way to save money for the Christmas meal than by purchasing it unprocessed and taking care of all the prep work themselves? A live turkey, however, is much more of a vexation to have around the house than Pa had anticipated. The family spends most of its meager treasury building new temporary pens for the animal and moving it from place to place whenever the neighbors complain about the noise and smell, but it's when the kids name their new bird boarder ""Alfred"" that we get a pretty clear indicator there isn't going to end up being any turkey for dinner. Who wants to eat a bird one has actually named? Having spent most of their money on necessary adjustments for housing Alfred, though, and with no turkey dinner to be had out of it, the family is at a loss for their Christmas meal. Can they salvage a holiday to remember from table scraps, a few basic decorations and a small gift for each child, now that all their big plans for a sumptuous Christmas feast have evaporated?  This is a nice story for the Christmas season, emphasizing the importance of family over possessions, as well as the idea that it's the love behind the giving and receiving of Christmas gifts that makes the whole experience so memorable and nice. I would give one and a half stars to The Money We'll Save, and I'm sure it will do its part for many years to help brighten up the Christmases of children everywhere who love the holiday.",2,0.197,0.676,0.999

383,"This book has things going for it. I'll admit that. It is clearly written by someone with a lot of love for Harriet the Spy. There are moments, passing flashes, where the author manages a funny moment or turn of phrase which almost, almost echoes the charm of the original. It was well-paced and absorbing enough to keep me reading from start to finish. There are many excesses and violations against the spirit of the original which the author mercifully failed to commit.  Here is what's wrong with it.  1. Author not nearly as smart or funny as Louise Fitzhugh (but who is?)  2. Harriet defanged. She's too nice. She has a bit of the random sense of humor of the original, but she doesn't have the acerbic meanness or grand ego or delicious hatred or lonely angst.  3. Ole Golly defanged, although that's part of the plot. It's stupid, though. Really, Ole Golly shouldn't have come back at all, ever. That was like, one of the main points of the original book. I know it's hard to write Harriet the Spy without one of the major beloved characters, but honestly.  4. Plot turns out to be pretty stupid. It was touch and go for awhile and then it went. Got all goofy and improbable and sentimental at the end. If there is one thing Harriet the Spy shouldn't be, it's sentimental. ""No more nonsense"" is how Ole Golly ended her (canon) letter to Harriet, as the book reminds us, but doesn't adhere to that maxim.  5. Wrong level of detail. I was distracted by the amount of silly detail given--noting that Harriet wrote in an Ultra Fine Sharpie, for example--while at the same time there wasn't enough detail on other things. There was almost no information about Harriet's school life, or any of the things that really helped you picture her world in the original. On a related topic, what time period are we in, anyway? A lot of things (Harriet's father drinking martinis, use of the word ""fink,"" the family having a cook) don't make sense outside of the sixties, but certain details made me think they were trying to do it modern (FYI Ultra Fine Sharpie was introduced in 1989). Any book which leaves you in doubt as to whether the book was supposed to be set in 1962 or 2002 has insufficient detail.  6. Stupid new character I hate. Harriet has enough interesting friends; she doesn't need a Mary Sue who is So Quirky!!! and From a Broken Home and Also Interested in Spying. Bleeeecccchhh. (Although it's hinted in an ad in the back for another ""Harriet the Spy"" sequel that she's a lesbian, so I might read that, if it ever even got written.)  7. The main excess committed by this author, covering basically all the lesser ones, is a lack of subtlety. Harriet's mother isn't just rather vapid, she's a complete idiot; Sport isn't just tidy, he's a vacuuming fiend!  I can certainly imagine a less subtle book. I'm not saying it was the world's least subtle book. (I'll admit I didn't solve the ""mystery"" until Harriet did, but in my defense it was a stupid solution, and since when does Harriet solve mysteries anyway? She's a spy, not a girl sleuth.)  But the original Harriet has such a light hand, hinting at what's going on in the adult world without getting unrealistically involved in it (we find out about Golly and George's relationship through hints, mostly, not through direct explanation like in HSA). With the possible exception of Janie, none of the characters are caricatures (Harriet's mother is slightly vapid and doesn't understand her but isn't a complete imbecile like in HSA). Even people who love each other don't always understand each other or like everything about each other (Harriet and Sport, for example, are way too sympatico in HSA). Things are left unexplained (what's wrong with Golly's mother, for example, would never have been left so mysterious and raw and confusing and painful in HSA). A larger world is hinted at by meaningful details (Sport's interest in housecleaning is part and parcel with his father's inability to deal with life, not just something he likes because he is Quirky!

393,"Most people probably think of the cute animated Mowgli from Disney when they think of The Jungle Book, but the story of Mowgli is just one-half of the book. These stories are nothing like the Disney version. This is actually a collection of many stories and songs--14 in all including: ""Mowgli's Brothers"", ""Hunting--Song of the Seeonee Pack"", ""Kaa's Hunting"", ""Road Sonf of the Bandar Log"", ""The White Seal"", ""Lukannon"", ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"", ""Darsee's Chaunt"", ""Toomai of the Elephants"", ""Shiv and the Grasshopper"", ""Her Majesty's Servants"", and ""Parade Song of the Camp Animals"".  It's important to note that Kipling wrote these stories for an audience, his six-year old daughter who died quite young. They were probably meant to be read aloud, and perhaps as a bedtime story. I imagine they would be better read out loud and much more fun. The story of Mowgli almost gets lost in a silent read. For today's young people, it might be considered an adventure story, but adults will see the racism and imperialism present during the time of Britain's rule of India.  My favorite story, by far, was ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"". This was one of my favorite childhood television animated specials, a no-frills cartoon that came on once per year and captured the playful personality of the mongoose and the suffocating evil of the cobra perfectly.

The first was Belinda's behavior, the second was the fact that the dolls were given the ability to think and speak to each other.  Belinda's behavior. Absolutely atrocious. She is an untrained, unpleasant girl who takes delight in being rude and hurtful. She calls people stupid with regularity - including her elders - and she has an horrid, uncontrollable temper. Accustomed to being both the baby of the family and the center of attention, her jealousy is aroused by the attention that is given to Nona, even though they offer to include her in the project. She kicks things, shouts, and sticks out her tongue at people.  Now, Belinda is portrayed as being a bad little girl. But the most her mother and father ever do is tell her how disappointed they are and send her to her room. They never once provide her with moral instruction as to why her actions are wrong, and they certainly never spank her. In the end, it is her conscience alone that convicts her, and suddenly Belinda is very sorry for her selfishness. Then she is nothing but pleasantness for the rest of the book and everyone tells her how proud they are of her. I was glad she repented, but I felt that she repented more because she could not stand being disliked by everyone in the house than because she was sorry for her sins.  Miss Happiness and Miss Flower, although dolls, experience emotions - hope, love, fear, kindness, etc. They speak to one another and are extremely intelligent; they know all of the customs of the Japanese and understand people when they speak. As a plot device, this didn't bother me too much, but it has implications. Also, the dolls believe that if they wish for something - anything - hard enough, they can make it happen. And it works. They wish for all sorts of things, and always the person they wish it from will feel a sudden inclination to do exactly as the doll wished!  Conclusion. Mixed review. Miss Happiness and Miss Flower taught a great deal about Japanese customs and living. The style of the story was sweet. But its sweetness was mingled with problems. Your call!

468,"Making It Home is part history, part novel. It uses pictures - and even old photographs - to bring history to life for its readers. That, actually, was pretty cool.  However, the heroes of the story - three siblings - seemed too cookie-cutter to me. (Sorry.) They felt like stereotypes of children, instead of living, breathing characters, and that made it hard to identify with them. And the point of view jumped from character to character without scene or chapter breaks, which made things confusing at times.  But, aside from that, Making It Home would be an interesting book for young history buffs. And it contains games, recipes, and more that can help any reader bring history to life.",3,0.086,0,0.918

470,"Ordering this book blindly through Scholastic, I was interested in all of the children's books being written lately about the war in the Middle East. I knew nothing about the book, but was purely interested in the topic. Having now read it, I would tentatively place it in my classroom library for my lower readers. I think a handful of those still struggling (dyslexic or ESOL population) might find it interesting.  Esme is a second grader with an A-Z collection, literally, of stuffed animals. Each chapter begins with the details of how her animals came to join her menagerie: ""Goat: My dad's best buddy is Supply Sergeant Gabe Sutler. Dad says he has known him since ""basic"" (which is the beginning of being in the army). Gabe's job is to make sure every soldier has everything they need, from butter to bullets. By accident, a company once sent Gabe a box of stuffed goats instead of a crate of overcoats. This was unlucky for the army but lucky for me."" (p. 39) Being the child of an Army sergeant hasn't been easy for Esme and her family. There are frequent moves to sometimes exotic locations, but her dad manages to keep everyone in ship-shape order thanks to his military affection of routines. When her father is shipped out to the war (for only 100 days and 99 nights?), Esme is left to hold the fort with her mom and brother. Will she be able to help her mom and brother Ike, or will missing her dad overshadow her days and nights?  Told with simple language in the voice of a seven year old, I do think most of my readers would not dain to pick it up. This book is better suited for a younger reader than my own who WOULD find the plot and language choice interesting. A recipe for Esme's dad's famous pancakes (with yogurt) can be found at the end of the book, for the culinary artists.",3,0.109,0.263,0.968
471,"This is a ""different"" kind of Christmas story. Focused on the villains of the Fairtytale World and their plans for revenge and need to have a ""happily every after"". You have the Drama Queen, Rump (or Goldman as HE prefers to be called), Agatha, the dim-witted Giant and the Abominable Snowman who also owns the restaurant (the clubhouse?) where they all meet to make their dastardly plans to kidnap Santa.  I loved the black & white drawings, the visual descriptions used to describe their surroundings, the characters and they only make the story more interesting to kids and their parents who really should be reading it aloud starting about the age of 8 or so. I still haven't really decided which story this reminds me of - the writing is a bit different. It reminds probably most of the Lemony Snicket series (I think) with maybe a dash of Romona Quimby thrown in (the tiniest dash).  It's different and should appeal to middle grade kids everywhere - might even make a good stocking stuffer since kids love anything Christmassy year round.",3,0.388,-0.091,0.903
472,"I generally am not a giant fan of these ""crazy younger sibling"" books because they play on very similar tropes, and it can be tiring. That said, I think that Cleary's Ramona is one of the more believable crazy younger siblings that I've seen, and in the interest of rating the book based on what it is rather than what I wish it would've been, I upped the rating to 3 stars. Three things help to make Ramona believable.  1. Her antics are never completely over the top. I could picture my younger siblings (or even possibly myself, though I related more to Beezus) doing a lot of these antics.  2. She often gets a clear comeuppance. Unlike Judy Bloom's Fudge, Ramona gets punished by her parents when she does something wrong. This is important because a world that bends over backward to allow a crazy character to do whatever she wants stops being believable after a chapter or two.  3. A lot of humor is also derived from the over-inflated importance that Beezus puts into a lot of the problems Ramona causes. There are two important components to this: Beezus does over-inflate the importance of a lot of these situations (refer back to the first point about not going overboard in the crazy antics), and humor is derived from the over-inflation, keeping the entire book from falling into Wangst terrain.  Some aspects of the book did seem a little retrograde, but given when the book was originally published, that's an easily forgivable problem. For what it is, I think the book is of high quality. I'm just a little too old to fully enjoy it anymore, I think, but that doesn't stop me from appreciating it.",3,-0.055,-0.053,0.949

Not knowing how to handle these emotions, he grows a second head. This second head becomes a more aggressive version of himself, called Rikki. The two must learn to deal with each other and their emotions to get through life, which turns into quite the adventure.  I think the approach of the story is very creative and unique, but I'm just not sure what type of audience the writer wants to reach out to. It's categorised as a children's book, and the main characters are 11 year old children - but the situations they find themselves in, the language they use and the general theme seem far from a children's book.  Reading the first half of the book was great and incredibly inspiring, as I got to the second half I seriously needed a break.

529,"Source: I own this book.  Cost: Unknown  Title: The Haunted Mask  Series: Goosebumps #11  Author: RL Stine  Overall Rating: 3 stars  Carly Beth is so easily scared that it's actually a hobby of the people around her to think of new ways to scare her, and no matter how many times Carly Beth insists that she won't be scared anymore, she is. So in a plan to get revenge, she wants a Halloween mask so terrifying that it'll scare everyone...But when Halloween comes and goes...Carly Beth can't get the mask off...and it seems to be more than just your average mask.  This book was one that I would say didn't resonate with me as a child, and even less as an adult. I just don't really like this one that much.

542,"Reviewed by Natalie Tsang for TeensReadToo.com  Greg R. Fishbone's THE PENGUINS OF DOOM is a wacky, zany trip.  It's a series of letters by Septina Nash, our purple haired protagonist, as she tries to find her missing triplet sister, Sexta.  At first glance, Septina just seems to have an over-reactive imagination. In her letters to the Vice Principal, math teacher, gym teacher, school counselor, and Lieutenant Donna Morse, she describes her adventures of being an extra in music videos, becoming an Olympic freestyle skateboarder, stalker penguins, and having a mortal enemy named Doctor Fignizzi.  But low and behold, when her triplet brother starts backing up her story, we start to wonder if she really is telling the truth. Each reader will have to decide if Septina is a fibber of epic proportions or if she is just endowed with magical experiences. With helpful illustrations, Septina describes her extraordinary life in hilarious terms.  Remember, every number in the world can be made by a combination of 7s and 3s (1=7-3-3, 2=3x3-7, etc), and since Septina is both a seventh child and triplet, that means she can do anything!  Told in a cheerful and unique voice, this is a fun, quick read!",3,0.111,0.385,0.951

544,"Ten Second Synopsis:  Anastasia's world is turned upside down when her parents are unexpectedly killed in a freak vacuum-cleaning accident and she is whisked away to live with her strange and not altogether friendly Great Aunts in a sprawling house that used to be St Agony's Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Once there, Anastasia is plagued by the sense that something is not right - could it be the lunatic boy gardener, the proliferation of portraiture featuring monobrowed ladies, or simply the poor cooking that could be to blame?  The League of Beastly Dreadfuls has a humorous, light-hearted tone, which makes it very easy to flick through. I quite enjoyed the style of humour at the start of the story and even dog-eared a page that had the main character saying, ""Curse you, Winkles!"" after tripping over a garden gnome (named Winkles) because I thought that the phrase was one I could certainly slip into my everyday speech patterns. After initially enjoying the banterish, tangent-seeking style of humour, by about halfway through I felt that it slowed the pace a little.  The story is easy to follow and the mystery isn't too complex, so this is a good choice for when you are looking for a fun read that won't make you work too hard.  Without spoiling the plot at all, I really enjoyed the originality of certain talents displayed by certain young male characters that ally themselves with Anastasia. It's so rewarding to discover ""magical"" style talents and folk that aren't common in other literature for this age group.  The resolution to Anastasia's problems seemed a bit too wacky and convenient to me and appeared to be setting up for the second book in the series rather than solely concluding this one. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but I won't be chasing up the second as the narrative style grated on me after a while and I wanted the plot to move a bit quicker.",3,-0.056,0.023,0.728

555,"http://vanillamoonbooks.blogspot.ro/2...  It is normal to have many questions as a kid - about life, about society, about science. Curiosity does not always kill the cat, more than often it is the thing that helps humanity evolve and discover new things. In this book, experts in various domains, from physicists to professional football players answer to some of the many questions children have.  I believe I would have loved this book as a child, I often read things like this one - even though there weren't so many of them available then in my country. As an adult, however, I was able to view things a little more objectively.  Generally, most of the questions are pertinent and the answers are clearly formulated in simple terms so the children can understand the information given to them. It is nice to see the names and ages of each child who asks a question, but there were situations in which I thought considering the age of the little curious one, the answer was a bit too complicated or the opposite - an older child who I thought should be getting a more precise answer. Also, some of the questions are rather silly, and could have been easilly answered to by parents - so I couldn't see the point of being added to the book. I suppose it was for the comedic effect. I was not amused.  I will admit, however, that the question about goldfish knowing who their owners are was the exception here, since it was actually funny and made for a very attention-grabbing title for the book.  By the time I reached the half of this book, I started to get bored and a few pages later, the book turns to quizzes created by children - yay, I knew almost all of the answers - which I think would've made the book more fun if they were placed throughout it. If I was getting sleepy, then you can bet kids were too.  Finally, we get to the thing that annoyed me about this science book for children - the ending, consisting of 20% of my digital review copy was filled with information about the people who answered those questions. If they are also included in the printed copy, then I think this is a very sad waste of papers, since everyone who cares to find out more about these people can also use Google, thank you very much.  All in all, this probably still is very entertaining and educational for children, so if your little one is curious about science even the tiniest bit (or if you're trying to get him or her to be), you should try getting this title for them.",3,0.116,0.375,0.984

So we have Ally who has dyslexia and she thinks she is dumb or slow because she cannot read like everyone in the class. Being made fun of by class mean girl, Shay, enforces that Ally is weird and a freak so she always tries to get out of assignments. The biggest problem I have is that the principal does not even know that something is wrong with Ally until the new teacher, Mr. Daniels, figures it out and has Ally tested for dyslexia. You would think that if the oldest brother Travis had the same problems as Ally did, then the parents, teachers, and/or principal would figure it out as well. It just seemed extremely unrealistic that this came as a shock to the grown ups except for Mr. Daniels. Even though this book is supposed to be realistic fiction, there are a lot of unrealistic elements in the book, the biggest being how Albert stands up to his bullies.

But he's even more perplexed and overwhelmed when Aric wants his help to fight the evil Gorf, who is disguised as a popular new kid in Richard's class. What's worse is that there's a very simple way to defeat Gorf, but Aric can't remember it, leaving Richard to fend for himself in the fight against evil with very little but a wisecracking, condescending alien for backup. And if Richard fails, the consequences could be deadly.  The plot is pretty silly and whimsical--science fiction readers who like a little goofiness will enjoy it--but despite the awfully convenient fact that Aric's missing memory creates tension for the story, it actually leads to a decent amount of independence and angst for protagonist Richard. And hiding the villain as a likable kid in the class is pretty smart . . . you can feel the insidiousness there, and might actually fear for Richard's well-being if you're a sympathetic kid like I was. When Richard was getting close to failing his task, he even had to face a potentially fatal effect and counteract it while suffering from it, so it got kind of scary!

On top of that, we now need to know the other two books (which I read YEARS ago and barely remember) I found that odd in a companion book and is more in line with a sequel. The story redeemed itself for awhile with the scene with the Devil and his grandmother (who probably need their own series) and then tanked again with the big, long battle scene featuring a bunch of return characters I forgot about from the other books. I am worried about negative connotations toward parents who read or, gosh forbid, go back to school to improve their family's lot in life. Couldn't the mother have been doing something else? Making a tapestry or something? Why in this day with kids barely reading would we want to throw ANY negative light on reading at all?  Sorry, rant over.

593,"I was pleasantly surprised. Judging by the covers of these books, I wrote them off as overly juvenile, badly written, stupid wastes of time with irritating titles. Instead, I found a surprisingly smart story that reminded me a little of Calvin and Hobbes and a little of Dennis the Mennis, with a lot of gross humor. As far as I'm concerned, I won't rush out and read every one, but I also wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to the right reader.  This particular 'episode' of Captain Underpants had such choice elements as the ""Wedgie Wiggle"" and the ""Big-Butt Boogie"" dance steps. So I would definitely go with a reader who has a big, silly sense of humor. I can see how wonderful these books might be in order to get some enjoyment flowing with the reading - even if you're trying to be serious, who can help but laugh at a time machine made out of a purple porta potty, or a superhero who gets overly excited and accidentally leaves two old ladies (who he had been trying to help cross the street) up a tree when he gets distracted by a request to save a cat.

596,"Another one that I didn't read as a teenager. This one didn't have nearly as much drama as the first book, or maybe it was because most of it surrounded Enid and not the Wakefield family that I didn't find it quite so fun. It was also a good 60 or so pages shorter than 'Double Love', which made it shorter than some of the BSC books! I didn't realise the SVH books didn't have a standard page-length.  As usual, this book revolved around Jessica being jealous over the possibility of someone (Enid) getting something she had her eye on (being crowned queen of a high school dance) and scheming to get it, and ultimately upsetting a lot of people in the process. Most scheming goes on in this book in a sub-plot as Lila (jealous that her dad is spending all his time with a young teacher and not her) spreads a rumour that her French teacher is having an affair with a student. But everyone gets what they deserve in the end as Jess is forced to dance with Winston, as he is crowned king of the dance, and Lila has no date as Ken realises she initiated the rumour about Ms Dalton. Nothing is really concluded about Ms Dalton so I hope that's cleared up in later books, it would be horrible to have that sort of rumour on your academic record!  An entertaining enough book while I was ill in bed, and plenty of cute scenes between Liz and Enid and Todd to combat Jessica's scheming. Oh, to be semi-innocent in 80s Sweet Valley! There's a strange mixture of sweet naivety in these books with Liz and Enid having pillow-fights and baking cookies, versus Jess drinking wine at Lila's party and cars parked at Miller's Point with steamed up windows. Plenty of hints at what teenagers really do, but no explicit details. Looking forward to reading #3! 6/10",3,-0.068,0.231,0.683

601,"I mostly enjoyed this book. I felt like it was a a unique idea for a kids book, kinda along the lines of Stardust, but more tamed down. Shine Star is a star and she wants to be with Goom'pa a little Poofy she met in the forest.  First off, I want a poofy! Actually, I'd like a whole tribe to come live in my house, I'd accept it because they sound so darn adorable.  Second, this was a really interesting book, but I did only give it 4 stars because I felt a little lost at times, as the chapters were so short and characters switched so quickly, so I worry if an adult gets lost, how will a little kid fare? That's really my only critique of the book. I'd love to know more about Poofy's too, but I'm hoping that might come in a later book. I felt really involved in the story, I was rooting for Shine Star and Goom'pa's love to win over the villains and work out! There's a lot more deep meaning to this book then compared to some children's books. It really deals with the feelings of loneliness, which is a great for a child, because depending on life and situations, child can get lonely easily.  I felt Shine Star was a fun character, she's always interested in learning, which lead her to Goom'pa, and I think it's another great message for children. She had a very interesting life, but again, we didn't get too much of her world and her people in this book, and I'd love to learn more, but her transformation at the end of the book was very beautiful.  Overall, this is a really catchy and well written kids story. It interests the reader, it's unique, and deals with some deeper themes which would be good for the adults reading as well as the kids listening.

Along the way he and Joe fend off greedy villains, meet a new friend and travel companion (Mike), and brave rough seas on their quest.  As much as I enjoyed this book, I do think of it as a boy's adventure story. The female characters are few and far between. At first I was concerned by the portrayal of Michael's mother, an overly trusting who sometimes seemed younger than Michael.

Half-listening to my spouse read The Little Prince aloud, I became intrigued, and when the children complained because he was nodding off (""Daddy, could you please read it less sleepily?""), I took over.  And now that I've finished the book, I find it strange because I like it, but I can't really figure out why I like it. Sure, there are some great passages, like the one that brought me in to take over the reading because I didn't want to stop listening to the story:  ""Whenever I encountered a grown-up who seemed to me at all enlightened, I would experiment on him with my drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I wanted to see if he really understood anything. But he would always answer, ""That's a hat."" Then I wouldn't talk about boa constrictors or jungles or stars. I would put myself on his level and talk about bridge and golf and politics and neckties. And my grown-up was glad to know such a reasonable person.""  That's out of context, and I'm not sure if it will make sense if you've not read the book, but that's also kind of how the whole book is. There are maybe a couple of soundbites, but mostly I find I have to look at it as a whole to get any sense out of it, and even then, I'm not really sure I've got it.  To me, The Little Prince is like a cross between A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist; I like it more than The Alchemist and less than Winnie-the-Pooh. I'm not sure what my kids think of it. They paid close attention, but they weren't really able to say at the end what it was about. I'll have to see over the next few days if the fox's or the lamplighter's (or the snake's) words show up in their imaginative play.  Some friends recently blogged about their experience sailing away from the United States and returning for their first visit in three years. They note that they really want to talk about how their travel has changed them fundamentally, what the differences they've seen between the places they've traveled and the places they've called home in the U.S. have meant to them as human beings, but many people they encounter just want the surface of things---the color of the sand, the warmth of the sea, the smell of the local foods.

She has loved food at a very tender age, and has since then experimented with recipes behind her parents' backs. It has gone so, so well, until she caught the kitchen's curtains on fire when she was attempting to make a Creme Brulee, a tasty French treat that assure you is as delicious as it sounds. She got banned from the kitchen, from looking up cookbooks, and pretty much everything that has anything to do with food and cooking, but what's she to do when she (unintentionally) finds herself hired to review a dessert shop for the New York Standard? Looks like her dream isn't yet ready to give up on her, either...  One word to sum up this book? Freaking. Adorable.  And it's not because of the food, either! The main character, Gladys, was such a sweetiepie. I loved how behind that timid and shy persona was a young girl oozing with passion. I loved how the mere sight of food (and real food, not just the fast-food half-cooked stuff that's served in East Dumpsford!) put her in euphoria. Her eagerness was so contagious that her descriptions of the Indian cuisine and the desserts in Classy Cakes pretty much sent my stomach to a grumbling and growling frenzy. But most of all, it was so admirable to see someone so young pursue cooking for the mere fact it made her happy and fulfilled. I don't remember being that way when I was eleven years old. I was awkward and all over the place, and I didn't know what I really wanted to do in life, and seeing Gladys like this made me want to be young again and be as full of fire.  At the beginning, she was quite hesitant to share her enthusiasm for food, and how could she not? For one, her parents were terrible cooks and fast-food-lovers who deemed cooking as an ""unapproved"" eleven-year-old activity. Her only friend in school, Parm, was someone who only ate cold cereal and plain spaghetti and had no palate for anything else. Her Aunt Lydia, who introduced her to cooking in the first place, lived so far away in Paris. It was therefore such a momentous moment to see her finally stand her ground and make her dreams come true on her own terms. She didn't wait for it to happen to her - she made it happen herself. She found ways. She exerted effort. She tried. And every step of the way you'll be cheering her on, because she braved the waves when it felt like the whole world was against her.  And the food descriptions! My goodness! They were such delectable delights, as they surely made my imagination run wild. It's no secret that this blogger here loves food. If I have to choose, I'd rather spend my money on going out to restaurants than on shopping sprees. Who could possibly resist dumplings, foie gras, or some pasta Alfredo? When Gladys recalled her foodtrip at her Indian friend's house, I was reminded of the Sultanate of Oman, an Arabian country I frequently visit where I regularly eat Arabian, Turkish, and Indian cuisine. It was so awesome to see the food so stunningly described here. They truly made my mouth water.  And the best part? THE PARENTS! Okay, okay, maybe they're not the best part, but they were an awesome factor nonetheless. They were a little on the bizarre side, but I really appreciated how they still looked after Gladys and how they were so worried she might be isolating herself too much. They definitely wanted the best for her, and you can see that in their actions, even if some of them were a liiiiittle misguided. The teacher, Ms. Quincy, was so awesome, too. It was so endearing to see a teacher truly concerned for the well-being of her students, encouraging them to give the very best in what they do. Like Gladys, you can see her passion in teaching. She was so inspirational, and it's really thanks to people like her that kids like Gladys get the courage and confidence to step up.  All in all, this was a cute, endearing, adorable, and stunning MG book that kids and adults alike will surely love. The heroine is awesome, the food is awesome, the writing is awesome, the messages are awesome, the whole package is awesome. This is a must-read, folks! Not only for your heart and mind, but also for your tummy!",4,0.274,0.435,1

Using firecrackers and noisemakers, the planned worked too well -- without the sparrows, locusts ate the crops, contributing to a famine that killed millions of Chinese during the following years.  This harrowing historical event is told through the smaller story of Ming-Li, a little girl whose love for birds causes her to save seven sparrows and win the respect of her father and his fellow farmers, once they realize that the sparrows had been necessary to control other pests.

709,"Told in the voice of a little girl, this delightful book takes a fun look sibling rivalry. When a new baby arrives, the little narrator isn't so excited. ""Can't we send the baby back?"" she asks at one point. Whereas most stories like this focus on some type of jealousy toward the younger sibling's attention from the parents, this book looks at it from a slightly different angle. The baby disrupts the young girl's routine. Her frustration stems less from the sibling and more from the idea of a child's first realization for the need to be considerate to others needs.  The girl's beloved stuffed animal, Little Monster, is her scapegoat in the story. A nice complex touch for young readers is that the stuffed animal is always presented as a real creature. It's up to the reader to eventually make that connection. Another aspect of the book that I love is the girl's point of view throughout the story. Even when she's in the wrong, she doesn't present it that way. I've always enjoyed that type of child character. It adds humor to the situation and forces the reader to identify the misbehavior in the character and ultimately in themselves...much like Olivia or Eloise.

712,"I had forgotten how cute and charming this book was. I love the movie, but I love parts of the book too, especially the stuff that didn't make it into the movie, like the real Perdita and her husband, the church the puppies visit, the two Nannies, and the boy with the little blue cart. The only thing that really annoyed me was the sexism. Yes, dog sexism. Missis, the mother dog in the book, is repeatedly presented as charming and pretty, but dumb. She can't tell her left from her right, even after repeated explanations, and the male dogs are like ""HA HA! WOMENZ ARE SO DUMB, AMIRITE?? NOT LIKE US BROS LOL""  However, there is the little bit in there about Nanny Butler who decides to become a real butler, NOT a parlourmaid thankyouverymuch, and she refuses to wear a skirt for the job, instead wearing pinstriped trousers and a frilly apron. Heh. So, women are allowed to have unconventional roles in this book, but it still annoys me that Missis is so dumb.  Cruella is way more fleshed-out in the book. She's married to a furrier, paints the interior of all her rooms red, and sleeps between ermine sheets. She invites the Dearlys over for dinner and everything she makes is a weird color (blue, black, etc.), and tastes strongly of pepper. This is supposed to be because she's a ""devil"" and she likes things ""hot,"" I suppose. She also has a white cat whose kittens she routinely drowns (NOOOO NOT THE KITTENS D: ), and the cat is dying to get revenge on her, which she does in the end.  One thing absent from the novel but present in the film is the class issue. In the movie, Roger is a poor songwriter and Cruella laughs at the idea that his songs could ever make money. Ironically, of course, the song that becomes a hit is ""Cruella De Vil,"" and then he and Anita have enough money to build their Dalmatian Plantation. (A phrase which, regrettably, is also absent from the novel.)  In the book, however, Mr. Dearly is a ""financial wizard"" who helps the government get out of debt several times, and in return they basically give him heaps of money forever. Cruella is obviously rich, or at least she likes to look rich, but the Dearlys aren't by any means poor, and they have no problem purchasing Hell Hall at the end of the book and turning it into a beautiful white country home for their Dynasty of Dalmatians. (And the white cat.)  Overall a fun book that goes into way more detail than the movie does, and it's worth reading just for that, if you're a fan of the movie. (The 1961 animated version, obviously, not the travesty that is the 1996 live-action version.) It's got a charming sense of dramatic irony, in which things we know all about are presented from the clueless dogs' perspective, which is always fun. Also, it tells you what happens to Cruella after she loses her beautiful fur coats...  ETA: I forgot to mention the adorable illustrations, and the fact that one of the chapter titles is ""The Hundred and Oneth Dalmatian,"" which always makes me smile.",4,0.067,-0.1,0.995

Of course the two mean girls did not want to apologize and weren't required to, despite he teacher's efforts. Howver, Dani offering forgiveness irregardless of their attitude was such a sweet moment. If only we could forgive so easily once we grow up.",4,0.175,0.833,0.954

715,"Ten-year-old Samuel Tan Cher Lock has an alias. In most respects, he's a normal kid. He goes to school, fights with his sister, and loves to eat. But when there is a puzzle to solve, his skill in figuring out the right questions to ask to get to the answer have earned him the nickname Sherlock Sam. And when a classmate in his new international school starts receiving sinister letters, it's time for Sherlock Sam, his best-robot-buddy Watson, and his team of fellow junior crime-fighters (aka The Supper Club) to step in and find out what's going on.  Set in Singapore, Sherlock Sam and the Sinister Letters in Bras Basah is a middle-grade Sherlck Holmes story with a modern update and an international flavor. Author A.J. Low (actually, a husband and wife writing team) takes readers on a tour of Singapore--introducing the culture, popular locations, and cuisine--without hitting them over the head with obvious lessons. Sherlock Sam and his crew are smart without being pretentious, clever without being encyclopedic, and interesting without being forceful. This story is just a charming middle grade mystery to delight young and old.  Sherlock Sam and the Sinister Letters is the third in the series (after Sherlock Sam and the Missing Heirloom in Katong and Sherlock Sam and the Ghostly Moans in Fort Canning). I've enjoyed this one so much, now I have to go back and start over from the beginning. If you have middle grade readers, I suggest you encourage them to give Sherlock Sam a try.  Galleys for Sherlock Sam and the Sinister Letters in Bras Basah were provided by the publisher through NetGalley.com.",4,0.229,0.182,0.417

720,"""Madlenka"" is a children's book by Peter Sis, illustrator of Rabbit Ears' ""Rumpelstiltskin,"" and was a selection for the Goodreads Children's book Picture Book Club and it details how a young girl named Madlenka goes around the city telling everyone that her tooth is loose while learning about other cultures from her neighbors. ""Madlenka"" is a truly cute story about exploring different cultures one neighborhood at a time!  When I first started reading this little unique gem of a book, I was totally blown away by the concept and the illustrations of this book! Peter Sis has done a brilliant job with both the writing and the illustrations in this book and I truly enjoyed the different perspectives of the world that this book takes. I loved the way that Peter Sis gave the readers information about various countries that were explained through Madlenka's neighbors and my favorite parts of this story was how Peter Sis introduced a variety of different greetings from each person that Madlenka meets along the way such as Mr. Gaston, the French baker greeting Madlenka by saying ""Bonjour,"" which is French for ""hello"" and Ms. Grimm, an old lady from Germany who greets Madlenka by saying ""Guten tag."" It was always interesting learning about the different greetings from around the world and I had the pleasure of repeating these phrases and learning about them every time. Peter Sis' illustrations are extremely beautiful and creative at the same time as Madlenka is always exploring different cultures through her mind. I loved the way that Peter Sis designed the pages to have die cut out windows in the middle of the pages so that way, when children turn the pages, not only will they see another country through Madlenka's eyes, but they will spot Madlenka on the other side of the page through the die cute window in the middle of the page. The images that really stood out for me were of how Madlenka viewed the other countries through her eyes as countries like France, Latin America, Germany and Asia were colored in dark and shadowed coloring which gives the images a somewhat creepy yet imaginative view on the other countries and their cultures. I especially loved the image of Germany through Madlenka's mind as it is mainly in dark green shadowing colors and you can see various surreal creatures popping out at you such as monsters and animals in the background.  The reason why I gave this book a four star rating is because even though I loved the concept about exploring different countries, I sort of wished that this book also explored other countries that were rarely mentioned such as Russia, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Greece and many others. I know that is a lot to ask for a children's book, but I wanted to explore countries I have barely heard of and I am always looking forward to exploring every single country around the world since I want to learn about various cultures around the world and this book could have shown a more simplistic version of exploring various countries that were rarely discussed through a children's book.  Overall, ""Madlenka"" is a cute story for children who are interested in learning about other countries and their cultures and many children will surely enjoy this book! I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since some of the images might be a tad bit too creepy for smaller children.",4,0.286,0.333,0.995

This book and ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" (by Scott O'Dell) really stuck in my head because they are both essentially about the same thing- a young girl surviving entirely on her own, and doing whatever it takes to do so. I've always been an independent kind of girl, and kind of a loner, so I found these books tremendously romantic. I especially liked that these were GIRLS- I liked the book Hatchet, but less so because the main character was a boy, and buy are just supposed to be able to do all of these things. Seeing girls survive on their own like this really hit home to me. Not that I ever plan on running away to the Arctic tundra, though :)",4,0.048,0.556,0.855

I had high hopes for the story, as my teacher Mrs. Williams had at that point required us to read as a class three books that I to this day consider to be among the best I have ever read (E.B. White's ""The Trumpet of the Swan"", John D. Fitzgerald's ""More Adventures of the Great Brain"", and Katherine Paterson's ""Bridge to Terabithia"").  The Cricket in Times Square was yet another unquestionable hit, in my eyes. I loved the general feel of the story, as the narrative followed the beginning uncertainty of the misplaced Chester Cricket while he tried to find his way around big New York City without a single friend to help.  I love the fact that caring people found their way to Chester and were willing to not only come to his aid, but be his friend. Harry the Cat and Tucker the Mouse and Mario the newsboy were ready and willing to fill the roles in Chester's life for which he needed them, and the result is a series of unforgettable tales and enchanting encounters that remain with me in a way that no other book quite does. I have not read much else by George Selden, but even if he had never written another story, I would always fondly recall him for his magical ""The Cricket in Times Square"". It is a book that I always highly recommend.",4,0.429,0.875,0.977

737,"Children get to write their own ending in this sweet early chapter book  To see how how my 7 year-old son and 11 year-old daughter finish the story, come visit us at Mother Daughter Book Reviews.  I was very excited when I was asked to review this book because I love the concept of ""interactive"" books. We have reviewed When Sam Set Sail by LeAnn Beck which allowed for children to illustrate the story themselves and we frequently borrow the Choose-Your-Ending stories from the library. I tink that there is some benefit to these types of stories as the reader moves from being passive to being active in the story. In the case of Finding Fuzzy, the reader is only taken so far in the story, and it is up to them to create a fitting end to the story.  The basic premise of the story is that a young girl, Jenna and her family, go on vacation to the oceanside where Jenna loses her beloved stuffy, Fuzzy. While initially she is devastated, Jenna's sisters support and comfort her and she eventually begins to accept that Fuzzy may be gone forever. But, just as the family is wrapping up their vacation, they discover that Fuzzy was ""taken"" and is being used as a bed for some newborn kittens. Jenna must decide if she will leave Fuzzy behind to protect the kittens or recover her beloved friend. The book itself has beautifully designed pages where kids can write and draw out the rest of the story, or these pages can be downloaded directly from the author's website.  Children aren't left to their own devices in undertaking this exercise. The author has included a guide for parents or teachers, (referred to in the text as ""Reading Assistants""), to help children think through their ending before they put pencil to paper. For example, there is an outline of steps in the process of creating an ending: 1. Brainstorming ideas; 2. Narrowing the ideas and thinking through the consequences of each option; and, 3. Expressing themselves through writing (verbal learners) and/or pictures (non-verbal learners). I thought this was an easy-to-use and very helpful guideline.  One final word about the illustrations... Irene A. Jahns provided the beautiful water-color illustrations to accompany the text. Finding Fuzzy is considered an early chapter book and children who are newly independent readers still do prefer illustrations in the books they read to break up the monotony of the text. Jahns does an amazing job of creating a ""vacation"" mood for the setting through the depiction of sweeping oceanside landscapes and snapshots of images such as a sand dollar, a beach pail, a barbecue, and more images that will leave you longing for summertime adventures to begin.  My Bottom Line:  Finding Fuzzy is an early chapter book featuring the opportunity for children to create their own ending to a sweet, summertime story. The main character, Jenna, has a decision to make when she discovers that her beloved stuffed bunny she had lost is now being used to protect a litter of kittens. After weighing out all of the possible outcomes, it is up to the reader to decide what happens next in the story. I thought this was a unique concept that will interest children, especially ones who are interested in writing their own stories (like my daughter!). I recommend this book to parents, homeschoolers, and teachers with children between the ages of 5 and 10.",4,0.272,0.667,0.998
738,"First of all, permit me to explain that this is the first book in the series I have read. I realize this is the end of the trilogy, but I had no trouble jumping right into the action. It is a fairly simple book to join ""in process."" This meets its target audience in that there is no sex, violence, nor profanity. It is a clean read, and if your tweens love fantasy, this may be just the book for them.  Although the book is well-written for its targeted audience, I do have one minor criticism. I felt that the book was often rather dark and heavy. I never felt that there was a light, comical moment, and it dealt with serious issues. Seeing how this is a ""coming of age"" fantasy, I suppose I can understand and appreciate that. And perhaps if I had read the other two books first, I may have been able to appreciation the somber tone. I just would have enjoyed some humor to mix things up a bit. I can always tolerate fantasy novels much more when that is included.  I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

The mystery surrounded the theft of the lump is only part of the story. As readers we get to soak in Angleberger's version of Victorian England. In many ways the plot reminds me of a combination of an Agatha Christie mystery and just about any episode of the Office (if both of these were written for kids).  All the central characters are quite over the top. Including the selfless kitchen boy Horton Halfpott. One of his endearing traits is is complete and utter honesty. M'Lady Luggertuck is an almost lovable tyrant and the stable boys who help Horton when he is framed are quite cleverly named Blight, Blemish and Bump.  Since it is a fun quick, read with lots of ideas to discuss I can see using this as a read aloud in the coming years.  As a side note, I think that Angleberger leaves little nods to literary characters and places for his more experienced readers.

He eventually agrees to walk with Duck, but he will not hike! So Goose and Duck walk all the way through their meadow, and keep walking until they see the beach. Duck is so excited he runs all the way down the hill to the beach without waiting for Goose. But when he gets to the beach he's not as impressed as he thought he'd be. The waves are loud and the sand is hot.  Goose, however, is amazed at the water. He runs towards the water, not waiting for Duck, and splashes into the water. He quickly learns that the waves are strong! Goose and Duck meet friendly animals and not-so friendly animals, quiet and loud animals, built a sand castle and listened to the ocean in a shell.  After enjoying their day, Goose more than Duck, both friends wandered back home to the meadow, their favorite place in the world.",4,0.507,0.714,0.987

I also opened it with a groan because the official summary on the copyright page includes this: ""new nanny Calista helps him uncover his strengths and take pride in himself"". Gag me. I don't really want to read a book about those things, and there's not much I hate like a kids' book where grownups help the kids solve all their problems (see: Wonder). But that summary doesn't do the book justice. There ARE a lot of helping grownups in it, but they didn't feel too intrusive. And Calista is kind of a manic pixie dream girl (in both personality and function), except that she isn't, because the book also hints that she has a life of her own, that her sole purpose is not to help Albie ""discover himself"". Anyway, she's an important part of the book, but not necessarily more important than Albie's great best friend, Erlan.  Calista does several things that I thought weren't quite right, and I was surprised that... that didn't always turn out quite right.

In fact, the whole family is full of characters, each one with their own quirks and likeable features. From the father, who bulldozes ahead to give his family memorable vacations, to the mother who is wise, understanding, caring and smitten with mystery novels, to evil Aunt Avril, who's really not so evil and Nanna, the wonderful Grandmother we all wish we had, the entire clan is endearing and exasperating, as all families are.  ""The Venetian Job"" is the third installment of The Max Books and each one gets progressively more entertaining, due in part because you come to like these characters more and more with each book. Even if you don't have small children, or don't generally read children's books, I would recommend The Max Books. They are very enjoyable and will bring a smile to your face.

I love Roald Dahl and as David Walliams style of writing is considered very similar, I thought I'd read this book. I adored it and as a child I can imagine that I would have devoured each and every one of his books in quick succession.  This book is about a lonely little girl called Chloe who befriends the local tramp, known as Mr Stink. She ends up moving him into her garden shed. The Quentin Blake illustrations are brilliant but then he's one of my favourite illustrators. This book is a heart warming tale with a heavy dose of humour. I adored Mrs Crumbs Manifesto when campaigning for MP and Annabelle's timetable of extra curricular activities. I think the perfect age for this book is around 8 years old. My son is 6, and I'm looking forward to introducing him to David Walliams's books in the coming years.",5,0.393,0.176,0.962

After an unexpected death Kaya must learn to accept her gift from the person who has died so they can move on. This is a great book about death and grieving for the young.

Of course, I love books about sentient toys (starting with my childhood copies of ""The Doll's House"" by Rumer Godden and ""The Best-Loved Doll""), but this one is beautiful, simple, heart-rending, and remarkable. There are definitely dark parts; if ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" is too harsh for you, you won't be able to handle this. But this book contains incredible lessons on life and love. The title calls Edward's journey ""miraculous""; I've often heard pastors say that the greatest miracle is the one God works in a heart to change a sinful,selfish soul into a Christ-follower. Well, here the miracle is how Edward changes from someone who receives love but only cares for himself, to someone whose heart is filled with love for others. Yes, some pretty harsh things happen in this book (read it for yourself before you give it to your child if you're sensitive), but as the Dread Pirate Roberts said, ""Life is pain; anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something."" Life IS hard, but it is love, compassion, and sacrifice that make is beautiful. This book contains a powerful message of love and loss.",5,0.185,0.31,0.998

But Wonder was one of those rare stories that I wish continued right along without ever stopping.  I laughed and I cried. Oh man, did I cry. There is no shortage of feels in this book. But not once was it melodramatic. Yes, it's written with an 8-12-year-old audience in mind, but there are so many truths, so many life lessons here that apply just as much to us adults as they do to children. And not once was it condescending or didactic.

So many and varied creatures and objects exist that are of blue colorization and yet we miss it in our daily lives. Yes, we delight when we see a Blue Bird or a Blue Jay and we love blue flowers and blue skies, but there is more, so much more.  Isabelle Simler has gathered this variety from across the globe and all climates. And then she has settled them what is known, especially in the photographic world, as ""The Blue Hour."" Just what is ""the blue hour""?  ""The blue hour (from French l'heure bleue) is the period of twilight early in the dawn each morning and late in the dusk each evening when the sun is at a significant distance below the horizon and the residual, indirect sunlight takes on a predominantly blue hue. This effect is caused by the relative diffusibility of short blue wavelengths of light versus the longer red wavelengths. During the blue ""hour"" (typically a period about 40 minutes in length), red light passes straight into space while blue light is scattered in the atmosphere and therefore reaches the earth's surface. Many artists treasure this period because of the quality of the light."" (source -Wikipedia)  The children's picture book uses limited text with beautiful artistry predominantly in blues with vivid touches of other colors to tell the story of how the world and its creatures settle down for the night and it is such a gentle, sweet story.  I found the book to be a treasure in that it is a gentle bedtime reading, an artistically beautiful book, educational in global placement of all the creatures, and an introduction into the ""blue hour"" phenomena. And there is also the two pages at the beginning with circles of named shades and hue of blue with will prove to be a great tool for identifying specific blues.

I just wish I could have found friends as cool as the ones in this book.  Re-reading this as an adult I remember all the reasons I loved it. It's smart and doesn't assume that kids are idiots. It deals with serious themes, but doesn't pound you over the head with them nor does it trivialize them - they are part of the world we all live in.  There are so many subtleties in this book - the relationship between April and her Grandmother, the latchkey kid phenomena, the loneliness of the shopkeeper who watches the kids play through his window, the frightening events in the neighborhood. All of these bits of the story are interwoven with the day-to-day lives of the children and their playing at being Egyptian. This book is also effortlessly multicultural and that's pretty wonderful, too.  It was so great to revisit this old friend and nice to see how much I still love it after all these years.

864,"This book was pretty awesome. I would have loved it as a little kid. George is the child of environmentalists who refuse to use any sort of technology in their home, to include electricity, processed foods, or a vehicle. He's always embarrassed because he doesn't have a tv or computer like other kids do, although he does have a pet pig which is pretty cool. George's dream is to have a computer, but is parents won't allow it.  He finds out his neighbor is a scientist who has a super computer named Cosmos, who can actually create portals into space. The scientist, Eric, shows George the computer and uses it to teach him about the Universe. A few mishaps happen...George and Annie, Eric's daughter, don space suits when Eric isn't home and use Cosmos to go out into space. They sit on a comet that is passing through the solar system, watching the planets...but what they didn't expect was to almost be pelted to death by asteroids when they pass through the asteroid belt.  Anyway, with his new knowledge from Cosmos, George wants to enter a school science competition. The first prize is a brand new computer. But when he goes to have Eric check his speech for accuracy, Eric receives a note from a bitter scientist telling him of a new, earth sized planet that could harbor life. But it's a trick...the planet is near a black hole, and before George can warn him, brilliant but naive Eric takes off through a portal to check out the planet. While he has disappeared, the bad guy steals Cosmos. It's up to George to rescue Cosmos, figure out how to save Eric from the black hole, and still make it to his competition on time.  It's a great book, and actually gives a very strong environmental message, despite George's quirky parents. It emphasizes that science is not evil, but that it can be used that way when people use it without regard to its consequences, and that it should be used to further the protection of our environment.  The only negative comment I have is that the book is interspersed with little mini lessons and photos about space and science...which is great...but sometimes they interrupt the story mid-sentence and it's kind of jarring. I think they should have been put at the end of chapters so you weren't having to finish a scene and then go back to them.",5,-0.041,0,0.961

872,"My mom bought me this book when I was in elementary school and - I don't remember why - I was adamantly against reading this. I picked it up because of the Austentatious Book Club and I'm so, so, so glad I did. Anne of Green Gables was such a great read that I've added it to my All Time Favorite Reads list. Seriously, I loved it. I can't express how much I loved it.  Admittedly, there isn't much of a traditional plot. It's more like a series of stories about the ever-charming Anne Shirley. Because of that, the pacing varies a lot throughout the book. I didn't mind any of that; Anne made up for any shortcomings.  The characters are what made this book so great. I don't think I've ever loved a character as much as I loved Anne. She has such a personality - impulsive, good-hearted, and stuck with her head in the clouds. Montgomery did such a good job of getting Anne's personality across. The page long monologues of Anne just chattering away added so much to her character and numerous times I found myself smiling. Anne charmed me as much as she charmed every other character in the book. I really, really love her. I was constantly amused and enamored by the words she used (tragical was one of my favorites) and how she found beauty in everything.  And of course, I loved Marilla and Matthew. Matthew is such a sweetheart! He and Anne's interactions were always a treat. My heart swelled every time Matthew expressed his pride in Anne or bought something with which to spoil her. Marilla was so different from Matthew, not wanting to spoil Anne or express her pride for fear of making her vain, but I loved her nonetheless. Her relationship with Anne was just as great as Matthew's.  I absolutely adored Diana and Anne's friendship. It was one of the best female friendships I've seen in literature. Best friends through and through, despite bumps in the road.  Anne of Green Gables certainly isn't short on great female characters. Ms. Stacy and Mrs. Allen were excellent mentors for Anne and are great examples of capable, intelligent women. Even Mrs. Lynde, who didn't approve of women taking on roles (like teaching) that were typically reserved for men, was a dynamic and fleshed out character and I loved her as much as any of the other characters.  When I started this book, I wasn't planning on reading anymore of the books in the series, but having loved the book so much, I'm sure I'm going to continue the series at some point. I'm excited to see how Anne and Gilbert's relationship will develop!  In short, I absolutely adored this book.",5,0.554,0.647,0.999

894,"Reviewed by Michelle Stanley for Readers' Favorite  Easy 8: The Big Event is an action book for children by Carrolyn Foster. Bull riding season is almost over and competition is fierce among the contestants. Every bull is determined to achieve the best score to win the Bull of the Year award. Winter Hawk and White Cloud are two of the Native American bulls who entertain spectators with their ceremonial dance honoring Mother Earth.  The first bull riding contest commences with Mosshorn. He's impatient with the cowboy riding him and can't wait to toss him off his back. Sagebrush is next and he wants to give his cowboy the dance of his life. Flapjack, a snot slinging, smoke blowing bull, believes his rider won't last the eight-second contest. Each animal has his own bag of amusing tricks to outwit their cowboys, but who will be crowned Bull of the Year?  Easy 8: The Big Event is an amusing action novella that will keep young children entertained. The illustrations are very lovely and each one depicts a bull who tells about the antics they perform with their witty remarks. Carrolyn Foster also includes a free audio book download so kids can follow along while reading the story.  She has cleverly written about a popular event that teaches kids about bull riding, but her story is primarily from the bulls' viewpoints, which is funny. They are smart and adorable and I know kids will be fond of them. Carrolyn Foster's novella is a delight to read and is recommended.",5,0.429,0.381,0.997
895,"Again, I've chosen to review a specific Kindle edition of a classical novel because it contains the original illustrations, these ones by Arthur Rackham.  In one way, you could consider this book as the prequel to the Peter Pan that we've grown up with. In another way, it's an idea at an earlier stage of development in the mind of the author, J.M. Barrie. In fact, it wasn't even a book about Peter Pan at first, but a chapter or two or three from (eventually five) from a longer book, called The Little White Bird; or, Adventures in Kensington Gardens. That was a rather long rambling set of anecdotes and stories and accounts of his walks with a 6-year-old boy name David -- his real name: George Llewelyn Davies, one of two brothers who helped inspire both Peter Pan narrative, and the character of some of the ""Lost Boys"", as well as the memorable quote, ""Death would be an awfully great adventure"".  I sort of envy writers of that time. They could ramble on and on, and as long as it's interesting, it would sell. In the writing of the rambling narrative of The Little White Bird, the idea of Peter Pan grew from one chapter to five. Those chapters, 13 through 17, were later made into the shorter book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.  The first chapter is a guided tour of Kensington Gardens, along the rout that the author was used to walking with ""David"", in which he shares a number of amusing, if not rather tall stories behind the various landmarks. A Google search (with Google Maps) will show that many of these landmarks still stand along that route. He refers to the statue of Queen Victory as ""The Big Penny"", and tells a story about it that only a 6-year-old would believe. The entrance to ""The Broad Walk"" from Kensington High Street is called ""Miss Mabel Gray's"" gate. From the best I can Google, Alice Mabel Gray was a back-to-nature enthusiast who ended up in what later became the Dunes State Park in Indiana, U.S.A., and whose ghost has been reportedly seen skinny-dipping in the lake. I suppose the story he tells David is in character, though he describes her as a proper little girl who suddenly developed a wild streak.  The story of Peter Pan himself, begins with him as a new-born baby, lying in a cot near a window, from which he can see Kensington Gardens, where he used to fly about as a little bird -- oh, did I tell you that babies were birds before they became babies, hatched on Bird Island in the Serpentine Lake in Kensington Gardens. Being new to human babyhood, he missed Bird Island, so he did as all babies can do -- until they're told they can't. He flew out the window, and back to Bird Island. Sitting in the tree, talking to the old crow in charge, he's told he's no longer a bird, an therefore, can't fly. So, he's forever a baby living on Bird Island, wandering about Kensington Gardens after ""lock up time"", when the fairies come out.  Another character in the story is Maimie Mannering, a 4-year-old who scares her 6-year-old brother at night with stories about an imaginary goat. She's the prototype of Wendy Darling, whom all of us know well, even down to the confusion between a kiss and a thimble. -- Okay, no more spoilers...  It was when George Llewelyn Davies (aka ""David"") grew to be a 10-year-old, that Peter Pan also grew. Barrie wrote the stage play that we're now familiar with, and later the book, Peter Pan: or The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up. Apparently, there's a vague hint in the latter narrative that Peter Pan lived in Kensington Gardens as a baby, but as he began to grow, they moved him to Neverland.  I'm giving this five stars as being a good, delightful, educational book about the origins of the Peter Pan tradition, though some would be put off by the narrative style, which, as I said earlier, might not have enough focus for the modern reader. If you like this sort of thing, like I do, it's five stars.",5,-0.006,0.122,0.993

""John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat"" is a great tale of true friendship that children everyone will enjoy for many years!  This book was apart of my childhood and it has always remained favorite story of mine for many years! Jenny Wagner had done an excellent job at writing this book about friendship and jealousy. I loved the way that Jenny Wagner brought out the theme of jealousy in this book as it was shown in a way that was never shown in many children's books before. I was amazed at the slight intensity of John Brown's jealousy towards the midnight cat as he went as far as to tell the midnight cat off and I think that many children will actually see the damage that jealousy could have on the family as John Brown's relationship with Rose slightly intensified and also many children will easily relate to John Brown's predicament as they probably felt jealous whenever a new sibling or relative comes to the family. Ron Brooks' illustrations are extremely beautiful, especially of the images of Rose and John Brown being together. I loved the images of Rose and John Brown as John Brown is drawn as a black and white sheep dog while Rose is drawn as an elderly kind-hearted woman who wears a pink jacket, a yellow dress and pink slippers which indicates her kind nature. I especially loved the image of the midnight cat as it seems to glow in the dark and yellow eyes that also glow and it has black fur which makes it look mysterious.  The only problem I had with this book was the message of this book seems a bit unclear to me. When John Brown became jealous of the midnight cat and Rose kept on asking to invite the midnight cat inside the house, I felt that Rose should have assured John Brown that she will always care about him even if she has the midnight cat as company and the way Rose rarely mentions that to John Brown sort of makes me a bit uncomfortable. I think that if parents go through the phrase where their child is jealous of another child's company, they should always assure the child that they will always love them no matter what situation takes place.  Overall, ""John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat"" is a cute story for children of all ages could enjoy for many years, however parents might want to reassure their children that they will always love them if a new sibling or a new relative comes to the family before they read them this book.",5,0.162,0.368,0.997

910,"I don't even know how to go about this review without gushing like an incoherent loon.  [Nope, as it turned out, all I had to do was sound really melodramatic and um...intense...Oh, boy.]  I mean, really, I don't know that I have a single bad thing to say about this book. I loved reading it for the beauty of the storytelling and for the way it made me feel, and I respected it for the same reasons as well as one very important one: Anne Ursu respects her audience.  It is very, very rare to find an author - or an adult, for that matter - who respects children and what they are capable of. So many adults who have dealings with children (parents, teachers, authors, etc) have a tendency to sugar-coat things and say that kids ""aren't ready"" for certain things; they pretend kids ""won't understand"". They have forgotten what it is to be a kid. I think, when we force ourselves, we can all remember what it was actually like to be a child and to be ""treated like a child"" - to have the adults around us speak of things as if we don't understand, or try to hide things from us that we already fully comprehend. As if a child isn't aware that they are growing up with divorced parents or an alcoholic mother, or an abusive father or anorexic sibling. We all joke about kids being mimics (don't they just say the darnedest things, I wonder where they come up with it), and we turn a blind eye to the fact that they are taking everything in and feeling and understanding and worrying about a lot more than we ever give them credit for.  It's so very rare, then, to find an adult who realizes the strength and understanding children really do have, and embraces it and showcases it. [Side note: I have a little story about this, but I will save it for the end, since it really has no place in this review...] I find it so refreshing and so much more powerful when an author just writes, just tells the story that needs to be told, and trusts their audience to understand it. Anne Ursu does just this. Ursu does not pander to her audience or hide from less pleasant aspects. Her story is non-flinching and not necessarily going to have a happy ending. No magic wand is ever going to be waved. There are a lot of villains in the world, and they come in all sizes, but there is no Big Bad Villain, just time. Ursu tells a story that I think will be embraced by children - who will respect it without even realizing they are doing so, or why - and will be enjoyed by adults - who will find there is more in it that they would have imagined they'd get from a middle grade novel.  There is a depth of pain to the story that I found really affecting; I didn't expect it to have such a range of experience and emotion. I don't want to turn anyone off by saying this, because it is not like it's some sob story written with the intent of making you cry. (I loathe anything that makes me feel like I'm intentionally being played.) It's just, there's an everyday pain worked into the story. There are broken homes and mental illness and that mix of longings that seem to come at a certain age - the longing to be ""grown up"" and figure things out coupled with the longing to have things remain easy and carefree and the same. The story is deceptive in its simplicity: a contemporary retelling of a fairly unknown fairy tale that is layered with understanding of human nature, issues of self-identity, crises of faith and a friendship so fierce its heartbreaking. It's full of these melancholic little word-gems. Which, yes, sounds a lot more emo than I'd intended it to, but that doesn't make it any less true.  It was a very full reading experience. It was funny and modern and very, very true, and I adored Hazel. There is light to balance the dark, and a healthy dose of the magic and fantasy a story like this needs to thrive. We tend to think of coming of age stories as the transition into recognized adulthood, but I think this is very much a coming of age story for the almost-teen set. It's a time when friends do start to grow apart - and the very realistic pressure that Hazel (a girl) and Jack (a boy) face to begin growing apart, along with their desperation to go on as they were, felt very authentic to me. There's also this almost-but-not-quite metafiction aspect to it that I really liked. In some ways, on top of the very well done retelling, there is a focus on storytelling and the effects of stories in our lives. Avid readers, young and old, will see many familiar names and events from their own childhood faves and classics. It was well done - fun, like an easter egg hunt, rather than feeling unoriginal.  I've talked in complete circles, I know it. But I feel like I can't say too much, and I can't say enough. I feel like there is something here for everyone. You can read it as a fairy tale retelling and leave it at that. You can enjoy it as a coming of age novel and feel a little wistful. You can find yourself in the wood, confronting your own yearning and sadness, or just glory in the beauty of a good story, well told.  There is no real villain but time.  *And now, an unrelated-but-related story from my childhood: When I was in 2nd grade, my teacher read a story called The Faithful Elephants aloud to us during story time. It's a heartbreaking kids picture book (a phrase you do not hear often) about the bombing of the Tokyo Zoo during WWII. We all cried, students, teacher and aides alike. It was one of our longest story times because it was so hard just to get through.  Afterwards, we talked about the story and about compassion; about war and mankind and history.  Years later, when I was taking a Children's Lit class, I emailed my 2nd grade teacher and said ""I'm sure you don't remember me (she did), but I'm hoping you remember this"" and I described what I remembered of the story. I asked her for the name of it because I wanted to present it to my class, and I thanked her for having the respect for children to be willing to read that book to us and let us connect to each other and show what we were capable of understanding and feeling. Not many teachers would be willing to read a story that would make an entire classroom of 7 year olds cry. It was a ballsy move, and I respected her for it.  She told me that the timing of my email was perfect - the very next day she was going to an annual meeting where, among other things on the agenda, they would be deciding whether to allow her to continue reading that story to her classes. She took my email in; she retained permission. (She also bought me a copy and signed it to me, thanking me; it sits proudly on my shelves to this day. She died unexpectedly the next year, and I am so sad for all of the classes of children who are going to miss out on a teacher like her. I credit her with being one of the key people who inspired my passion for books.)  This, I think, is the power of storytelling, and this is why I respect books like this, that treat children as people, so much.  I hope you'll read this, and I hope you'll share it and all of your favorite stories, with a child in your life.",5,0.039,0.339,0.999

912,"I did not acquire this book for myself. I have a nine (almost ten) year-old daughter who is positively enamored with horses.  My only experience with horses was more than a little negative and I was never one of those girls who just loved horses.  . . . unicorns . . . dragons . . . griffins . . .  But not horses.  However, my daughter loves them, so I snagged this series for her. And I can only hope she will enjoy reading them as much as I have.  This is so much more than just a book for girls who love horses. There's mystery. There's intrigue. There's a group of young teens who are determined to help out their friends (and younger brother).  I never knew that Miralee Ferrell wrote young adult books - much less such entertaining ones. It is so very refreshing to find such wonderful family-friendly stories that are not only suitable for all ages, but appealing as well.  I also believe these stories will be a tremendous help to those young adults who don't really understand things like autism. We could all use some positive reinforcement that shows us that just because someone is a little different . . . doesn't mean there is something wrong with them.  I highly suggest you start with book 1: A Horse For Kate, but I am someone who enjoys reading a series from the very beginning so that's just my personal suggestion.  Happy Reading!

Max lives with family in a small village near Mount Tibidabo that is besieged by bad luck every Wednesday.  To avoid the wednesdays, the creatures believed to be the source of the bad luck, the village shuts its doors on Wednesdays. People stay in doors unless it's an absolute emergency. Max, though, on his birthday, decides he's had enough of being stuck in doors, and goes out in search of the wednesdays.  Just as Wendy's wish to meet Peter ends up being a whole lot more trouble than she had expected, Max's successful encounter with the wednesdays leaves him cursed by his own personal bad luck. A boy who can bring bad luck on any day of the week quickly becomes the town pariah.  Bourbeau keeps the problem at hand focused on Max, his bad luck and the town's on-going history with the wednesdays.

947,"These ""You Can't Take a Balloon..."" books would be great gifts for grandparents to give to grandkids, as I realized with this second published book. The first book is a grandmother taking her granddaughter to The Metropolitan Museum in NYC, this second book is the grandmother taking that same granddaughter and her younger brother to the National Gallery museum in Washington, D.C. (I have the third book in hand and it looks as though both grandmother and grandfather are taking both grandchildren to the Fine Arts Museum in Boston.)  I love how life mimics art and art mimics life as the balloon travels around D.C. and the people view the art in the National Gallery.  You Can't Take a Balloon into the Metropolitan Museum, the first book, was virtually completely wordless. I really loved it because I've spent time in New York and so much was familiar to me and the wordless storytelling was brilliant.  This book was slightly different from the first book. It's a mostly, but not completely, wordless book. The people don't say anything but there are lots of signs and names of things. In addition to teaching about art, this one seems to aim to teach mostly about American history.  I actually think that while I rated this book 5 stars, it isn't quite as good as the first New York book, but this book and its techniques really worked for me because I've always wanted to go to Washington, D.C. to see all the museums, and this served the purpose of armchair traveling for me. The front inside cover has a map of the National Mall area with all buildings labeled. Thirty-two Americans who made a contribution (mostly in politics but also in activism, art, etc.) are depicted in the pictures, and at the end of the book those ""faces from history"" have a blurb about their accomplishment(s) and lives and it's told which page number they are on. Those ""faces from history"" definitely made me feel old, as many of them live/lived their lives that are fresh in my memory and are relatively current; there are some from America's ""distant"" past too.  As with the first book, I very much admire the illustrations. The use of a mixture of black and white with some color in each one is attractive and creative.  This is a great book for children who live in Washington, D.C., who have visited or plan to visit, those who are interested in or studying American history, and also American art. It would make a perfect book to read prior to any field trip to the National Gallery.  I appreciated that the two sisters who created this book dedicated it to their father, mentioning that he is an immigrant who loves the United States and how he has influenced their feelings about how they think and feel.  I would love it if one from one of the museums in San Francisco was featured because I know the city and its museums so well, and would also really like one from the Art Institute of Chicago, a place I visited three years ago and adored.",5,0.571,0.917,0.998

956,"Attack the Block crossed with Day of the Triffids - a children's story? Yep.  A bloomin' good one, too. Now nominated for the Carnegie, I hope it gets more attention, as this is a suspenseful, exciting and moving story that's part family drama, part sci-fi dystopia, with a very sympathetic hero.  Ade (pronounced Add-ee) and his mum live together quite comfortably in a high rise tower block in London. Ade's best friend lives in a tower opposite. Like a typical science fiction story, one day something unusual happens that at first seems simply strange, but soon metamorphoses into something much more sinister and dangerous, as first one building falls down... then another... and another... and then people investigating begin to die as well...  We see the reaction of the average person, as Ade tries to rationalise what is going on, and then his realisation of the danger. All the while, however, Ade's mum has closed herself off from the world after an attack of some sort that leaves her almost comatose and unresponsive as her son's world becomes a scary place that it seems he must face alone. School closes, the towers now begin to fall... and soon his is the only one left standing, with Ade unable to leave for supplies, and unable to rouse his mum. How will Ade cope as the world around him collapses?  A dystopian attack story with an under-ten as the hero? Very different. But a brilliant concept. I don't think it's too scary for the age group, for while there is death and destruction, it's written subtly enough to avoid graphic description. There's a detective element as Ade tries to work out what is happening, mystery of what has happened to his mum, the thrill of the 'invaders' unveiling, and a narrator who stays fairly calm and sensible, despite his isolation and loneliness. It's a brilliant read!  I was watching the film of this in my head as I read it, it would make an excellent film (or TV series) with some strong writing and characters.  You just don't know how it's going to turn out for Ade, the writing doesn't suggest it's going to be an obvious happy ending, I certainly prepared myself for tragedy, and right up to the climax I wasn't sure how the author would choose to end it. Loved how it all ended up, and yes, there are sad moments, but it's very tense and exciting as well.

No. Just because I loved this book, not to rid the world of injustice against potatoes. Keith Baker has created some sweet little potatoes here though (get it, sweet potatoes!?) and it rhymes so cleverly. The illustrations have lovely movement to them and you know that each time you turn a page the potatoes on the previous page are simply whooping it up, doing their own thing because you are no longer paying attention to them.  There are guest appearances by a few other interesting foods - a nice tomato and a huge watermelon - and the book ends down in the dirt where the potatoes grow. Each page has the potatoes up to some sort of clever mischief and despite the limited colour palate available to a book where the main characters are brown and their setting is mainly one of dirt, this book is still beautiful to read through and see again and again. The rhymes are great and the rhythm has that catchy beat that reminds me of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and everybody knows that is a great thing to read aloud.

The book I read as a child was the original one written by Brink but illustrated by Kate Seredy -- and it was that book with that particular author/illustrator combination that won the Newbery Award in 1936 -- and my reading heart.  .........................................................................  AN ASIDE: Some readers may not realize that the same year -- 1936 -- illustrator Kate Seredy had her own book in the running against CADDIE WOODLAWN for the Newbery Medal -- and lost.  THE GOOD MASTER which Seredy both wrote and illustrated (charmingly, I might add) did, however, receive a Newbery Honor award. In fact, two years later, Seredy's own book THE WHITE STAG won the 1938 NEWBERY medal and in 1940 THE SINGING TREE received another Newbery Honor Award.  While I agree that the Newbery committee chose the winning book wisely in 1938 -- at least between CADDIE WOODLAWN and THE GOOD MASTER -- it does seem to me that a reading experience is impacted not just by the text, but also by the illustrations, cover, font, and general book design, so for me the award was won by BOTH the author and illustrator combination.  Consequently, I saw with ambivalence a Newbery sticker on the cover of an updated CADDIE WOODLAWN illustrated by another gifted, but different illustrator, Trina Schart Hyman. For me, that CADDIE WOODLAWN was not the book as I remembered it.  .........................................................................  Nonetheless, what is more important is that upon rereading CADDIE WOODLAWN, I can recommend it as still having great value for today's readers, whether the choice is for adult and child to read it aloud or for a child him- or her-self to read it silently.

Book: Sorry I'm Not Sorry by Nancy Rue, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 2015  Genre: Realistic Fiction  Target Audience: Girls 11-15  Subjects: Bullying, Family Relationships, Friendship, Truth  Summary: Fine. Kylie will jump through whatever hoops she has to in order to get back on the cheerleading squad. If that means meeting with this dwarf person to do a social studies project, she'll do the project and get it over with. If that means assisting at a dance camp for little kids, she'll get through it by dragging Izzy with her. But she's not sorry, not for a moment! Hoops can be jumped through but that doesn't mean she has to change. Except... things are changing without her involvement. It seems all her former friends have turned on her. Photo-shopped pictures are floating around the internet citing Kylie as the true and only criminal in the whole bullying Ginger thing. And new pictures are coming, showing just how much she's not changing. Even though she is changing. It seems the bully is now the bullied.  Notes: The third in the Mean Means Makeover Trilogy, Sorry I'm Not Sorry gives the perspective of the bully. The first book looked at the situation from the perspective of the bystander and the second book was from the perspective of the bullied. This story picks up right where the second one left off. Kylie's attacks on Ginger have finally come to the attention of the adults and are being dealt with. Kylie is sentenced to Community Service and tutoring with Lydia, the counselor who helped the girls in the first two books. Kylie does change in this book, due to a few things. First, she becomes a victim as well and learns how it feels to be on the attack as well as how it feels to have someone stand up for you when the Tribelet comes to her aid. Second, her mom also gets some counseling from Lydia and becomes more involved in her life. Third, one of the projects Lydia has Kylie do is write up a list of requirements for being her friend, the rules htat sort of govern their group and then compare it to the Bill of Rights, causing Kylie to see that she's not standing up for the freedoms of her friends, but taking their basic rights away. And lastly, her community service project gives her a chance to see herself in a young girl and Lydia helps her to look at it from the proper perspective. This book doesn't have a ""happily ever after"" ending where everything wraps up unrealistically for the character. It shows a real picture of what it might be like for someone to change from being the bully herself to supporting the anti-bullying movement. It also shows how bullies can be formed - by example, by lack of proper correction and discipline, and by hurt. The spiritual elements are not real prevalent in this one. Lydia tells Kylie she'll be praying for her and Kylie says a nanny used to do so as well. Lydia says she thinks that's why Kylie adapted so well to the change she encouraged - God had been in her life for a long time and the nanny was probably still praying for her. And later, Kylie thanks God for her not being in the bully business anymore. Lydia also teaches her that one of the codes is from the Bible. At one point she tells Kylie she prays for her with every session, to be able to help Kylie. Those are the only references to anything spiritual though. However, the principles taught, like in the last books, are Biblical principles. The principles taught in this one are: Take your mask off (do not hide the truth or lie), No Rivals (Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, love your neighbor as yourself, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit), Consider the smudge (don't take the splinter of out of your brother's eye before first removing the plank in yours), Don't pull the trigger/Have a creative one-liner (be alert and self controlled). There is one area I disagree with though: the idea that Kylie is not a ""bad person"", she just does ""bad things"". The Bible teaches in Jeremiah 17:9, Romans 3 and other places that we are bad. There are none that are good, none that are righteous. The book is trying to convey that God did not create bullies. That's not who He designed Kylie to be. But the wording is a popular idea and I want to encourage adults to help young girls understand that they are bad - not just bullies, but all of us. But that's not what God created us to be and He can transform us into what we were meant to be when we put our trust in Him for our salvation and let Him do His sanctifying work in our lives.  I highly recommend this book to all young girls.  Also of note, this book is part of a much bigger movement to stop bullying. The links at the bottom will direct you to the resources the author has created to help go to war against bullying - because it is so NOT okay to ever bully anyone!  Spiritual Content Recommendation Scale: 4/5  Reviewer: J:-)mi  Romans 12:2 - Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--His good, pleasing and perfect will.  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, He is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!

992,"http://pebbleinthestillwaters.blogspo...  Book Review: Aesops Fables: George Fyler Townsend: A Must Read For All  Aesop's Fables Translated by George Fyler Townsend is a must read for all ages. It has a learning for all - a child, a youth and an older person. The difference between a Story, Parable and Fable is well articulated right in the beginning of this book to get everyone clear about what is what. The fables in this book have been picked from various resources as old as pertaining to 1610, from book Mythologica Aesopica by Isaaci Nicholai Neveleti. The other books from where these fables have been derived are - Febualae Aesopiacae from Francisci de Furia 1810, Delphin Classics 1822, George Cornewell Lewis 1846 and 1857. As usual, every fable has a great message and learning from it.  The story in Aesop's Fables, for instance, titled as The Bat and the Weasels is about a Bat who falls down on ground and is caught by a Weasel as its food. The Bat pleads to Weasel to pardon his life but Weasel resists and stays adamant on eating it saying a Weasel by nature is enemy of all birds. The Bat pleads further saying he is not a bird but a member of mice family. On this plead Weasel spares his life. Some other day, again, the Bat falls down on the earth and is caught by another Weasel who refuses to spare its life stating that any Weasel is bound to eat a mouse on which the Bat asks for pardoning its life saying that he is not a mouse but a bird. He gets another chance of his life when this Weasel also spares him on the plea offered by the Bat. Learning from story is that it is always good to turn circumstances to good account.  Another great fable is about an astronomer who used to go out every night to observe the sky. One night he fell in a deep well and start crying for help on which one of his neighbor tells him that for most of his life spent in finding out what is in heaven and sky, he should also have focused on what is there on earth!  Similar are the numerous other short fables where the crisp story part and a superb learning afterwards adds a good amount of wisdom to one's knowledge. Overall Aesop's Fables translated by George Fyler Townsend is a very interesting read along with a good amount of learning from each fable.",5,0.429,0.778,0.995

1000,"I love this book so much. I read it in 7th grade, and that was when I first introduced to the wonderful world of dystopian novels. Since then, I feel as if it is my favorite genre, fantasy coming in a close second though!  What I love the most about The Giver is how real it feels. I know some of the aspect seems a bit far fetched-only seeing in color, controlling the weather, the lack of freedom in the government system-but once I got passed all that, I could understand why the citizens would choose to live in this world. It's safe, and predictable-there are no wars, no real threats, and most importantly, everyone is the same-there are no social classes, there aren't people who get more while others get nothing. The idea that everyone is equal, is the main ideal that keeps this society functioning and if you really think about it, is that so bad?  Of course, what also intrigues me about this story is how rich in symbol it is. The fact that everyone sees in black and white, links straight to the way they live their life and how they see the world around them. The citizens are told what to do, and they never question it. They see everything as black and white, right and wrong and there is never any gray. In this sense, it makes them the perfect citizens, but it also makes them the worst kind of humans-the ones that waste and wither away until they die. Jonas and The Giver are the only ones who can see color and see that in life there are moments of golds and yellows, but also moments of black and gray as well. It really makes me wonder, what human beings would give up in order to be safe and secure. Lowry constantly demonstrates through Jonas, that as a reader we must also not go into this book seeing only black and white. Do not view this world and its people as idiotic and foolish, but think why this system works and the benefits of it. After all, all dystopian societies stem from the hopes of being a utopia.  I've read so many novels throughout my life, and this one always sticks with me as being a favorite. It's written in such a simple, yet beautiful way and it isn't a very long book, but there is so much to learn and take away from this story. A story that appeals to all ages, not just for the young.The Giver is a story that refuses to be forgotten once it is read, and there are very few books I can confidently say that about.",5,-0.063,0.235,0.983
