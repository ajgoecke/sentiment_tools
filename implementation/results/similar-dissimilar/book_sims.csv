 I enjoyed this book until Miss Arbutus Ward told us about her strange out of body kidnapping. I totally would have bought it if White would have built it up more, but it seemed to come out of no where. Why even mention the panther if it has no real purpose? 
 Also, Grandma, and just about every ill-habit-character found new meanings to life and so easily.

"422",422,"Any reader has a long list of books from their past that hover at the edges of their memory. You read them as a child, you grow up, you forget about them, until years later, picking up a copy by sheer accident, a sudden rush of memory flits through your blood like an electric shock as, for just a fraction of a moment, you are ten years old again, curled up in a quiet corner somewhere out of reach of all the annoying adults who are annoyingly prone to interrupting you just at the best part, so wrapped up in the book in your hands that an earthquake could pass you by unnoticed. 
 Of course you buy the book. Of course you rush home and curl up with it again, wanting to extend that feeling of untainted childhood pleasure that you felt with the book in your hand. 
 Sadly it's a hell of a gamble with that type of book. What is mindblowing at 10 years old is sometimes disappointingly empty when you are nearly 40. And so it is with A Handful of Time. I dug into the book wanting, waiting, and willing to be pleased, but unfortunately from the viewpoint of my adult self, this book is disappointing. 
 The idea itself is very good - an unhappy girl finds a way to go back in time and, in viewing the troubles of others, manages to get a grasp on her own. The execution of the idea, however, I find to be lacking. The situations, the characters, the morals and the lessons, all struck me as cardboard, flavorless, with nothing to make them come to life. 
 And yet I very clearly remember loving this as a child. And as a child, I had the same sort of issues the protagonist had. I felt isolated from my family, different from all of them, incapable of connecting. I struggled with loving things nobody else did, and trying to master the things everybody else did that I didn't actually care much about, but tried anyway just to fit in. 
 So... how do I rate this book? As an adult (and in order not to mess up my recommendations!) I have had to rate it as a 2. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't anything more than 'okay' and I found it rather more tedious than anything else to get through. BUT I if I were rating this without consideration for my own profile, I would have rated it 5 stars because it is a children's book, and I think that for children, especially young girls who feel a disconnect with the people around them, this book is likely going to be a 5-star experience. So if you're looking for you, pass it by. If you're looking for a little girl that you love and want to give something special to, this is a very good bet. But while you're at it, throw in another Canadian author's work and pick up Anne of Green Gables as well, for I feel it does a far, far better job of taking typical situations and characters and breathing a life and personality into them that will live into adulthood and remain one of those books that is a pleasure to read at any age.",2,0.023,-0.174,0.986,2.32

Vive con due adulti che chiama 'mamma' e 'papa', ma con cui non ha nessun legame di sangue, e semplicemente stato assegnato a loro dopo che chi di dovere l'aveva partorito. Non ci sono malattie, ne guerre e tutto, dalla scelta del lavoro a quella del marito/moglie,e regolato da rigide leggi che non permettono alle persone di prendere decisioni. Non ci sono emozioni,ne sentimenti,neppure impulsi sessuali, qualsiasi sensazione fisica o psicologica e stata inibita per il bene e la sicurezza della Comunita. Chi non e idoneo o non rispetta le regole viene ''congedato''. Quando un bambino raggiunge i 12 anni gli viene assegnato il lavoro che dovra svolgere per tutta la vita, ma quando e il turno di Jonas accade qualcosa che nessuno si sarebbe aspettato: non viene designato come i suoi compagni per un normale lavoro ma gli viene comunicato che sara il nuovo Accoglitore di memorie :ricevera dal Donatore tutte le memorie degli uomini vissuti prima di lui per essere pronto a diventare a sua volta il Donatore in carica. Le memorie vanno conservate perche quando ci sono grosse decisioni da prendere la Comunita chiede consiglio al Donatore, che grazie alla conoscenza e all'esperienza di centinaia di anni e l'unica persona a poter dare un consiglio giusto e saggio. Jonas scopre cosi emozioni e sensazioni che non aveva mai conosciuto prima e il loro peso minaccia di schiacciarlo. Scopre la neve, le stagioni, i colori, l'affetto e l'amore ma anche la sofferenza, il dolore, la guerra, la morte. Scopre cose terribili e inizia a farsi domande sul suo mondo: vivere cosi e davvero la cosa migliore per tutti? La goccia che fa traboccare il vaso e collegata a Gabe,un vivace bambino di cui si occupa suo padre,condannato al congedo perche ritenuto inadatto ad essere affidato ad una famiglia. Questo libro mi ha davvero stregato. Creare un mondo dal nulla e sempre una prova dura per uno scrittore e pochi ci sono riusciti davvero: Lois Lowry e tra questi. Attraverso le sue parole mi ha catapultato in questo mondo tutto nuovo e incredibile che a prima vista sembra perfetto,senza malattie,senza cattiveria,ma che pagina dopo pagina si rivela per quel che e davvero:una crudele dittatura in cui il pensiero individuale e le emozioni non sono permesse. Immaginate di non poter scegliere chi sposare, quanti figli avere, che lavoro fare, di non provare emozioni di nessun tipo. Certo cosi si eliminano cose negative come la disonesta, l'egoismo, le bugie ma anche l'amore e tutti i buoni sentimenti. Queste persone sono quasi automi. Fanno quel che devono fare e seguono le regole,meccanicamente,senza mai provare noia o frustazione. Questa societa e asettica,come un ospedale, e fredda e vuota.

 My problems were how the author made Brian double-triple repeat his thoughts and how some of the situations were too improbable. For example, a moose stampeding him into the lake and as soon as he crawls out a tornado explodes around him. Brian actually thought, ""I hope the tornado hit the moose."" REALLY?! Another issue I have is ""The Secret"" Brian is harboring. What is this terrible secret? His mom was in a car kissing another man before his parents divorced. I am not sure the point except to give a reason why he was taking a plane trip to see his dad in Canada. It ruins the flow of the story especially when he has some dramatic moment and then ponders about ""The Secret"". Gag me.

"396",396,"An excerpt from the author's bio: '""The Loneliest Robot"" was released in 2017 and is a highly original and imaginative work of fiction which challenges modern life and technology.' 
 Wall-E did it better. 
 Every page before the timeskip had a genuine and warm affect of a coming of age story that address the problems of technology and consumerism in a modern-esque world. What's refreshing about this story is that it directly addresses the disconnect that techonology has on human interactions and relationships. It could be a good read for the stated audience in the description above (""especially frustrated parents of technology-addicted children!""). I'll keep this review short and sweet. 
 Firstly, the story is devoid of character development, mind the robot UMA who naturally learns more about humans, love, etc. as the story goes on. My main problem is the development of Robert. While this book is aimed at young adult population, it does not excuse the poor character development of Robert that occurs after the timeskip. To keep this short, it took a direction that I personally felt was a betrayal of character for the sake of the narrative, rather than flushing out the character we were introduced to in the beginning. And yeah, I'm down with characters pulling a complete 180 and become unlikable, but only when it's done properly. Unfortunately, this isn't the case for Robert. 
 Another issue I had is the reptition of the concepts of technology and consumerism that became quite the nuisance. Yeah, it's toted as a ""dark comedy,"" but it became tiring after awhile, especially when the ideas remain static and unexplored. I get that a satire needs to hit on those points and be critical of it, but the story falls flat in trying to convey the purposeful and impactful message the author originally intended. 
 I wanted to like this book, I really did. My overall impression of the story is that it had a lot of potential, but gets lost in the redundant exaggeration of the concepts it tries to criticize, becoming silly after awhile. Do note that the abandonment of a key feature of the story is not revisited until the very end of the story, which ultimately led to my personal dissapointment in the direction of the story.

 Ken and Dan like hanging out with their other geeky friends, and often construct things out of rubber bands and chopsticks. When Ken finds a box on his porch, he figures it is something fun to construct that his grandfather must have left. He calls Dan, and the two follow the directions until they have a rough idea that the project is a robot. Unfortunately, the two have to go out and hunt down Ken's dog... and when they get back, the robot has finished putting itself together! Greeeeg is also demanding ""all the comestibles"" and stows these in his stomach section, which he mysteriously empties quickly and wants to refill again. John Henry and Jerry also gets a robots, and they, too demand food. Before long, the robots are on the warpath to find things to eat, working their collective way to a grocery store and wreaking havoc. Ken is still confused about where the robots came from, but he knows they are dangerous-- they process the food, turning it into highly compacted squares that they can fire out of their hindquarters with great intensity! Eventually, the boys work together to find a way to disable the robots and manage to avert disaster, and even figure out the origin and use of the machines. 
 Strengths: I loved that the robots were a project gone awry and was something that had the remote possibility of actually happening. The fact that the had ballistic farts didn't hurt. There are lots of funny lines (""He shrieked like a terrified ferret."") and slightly goofy if terrifying robot antics. The cover is great and will cause a lot of reluctant readers to pick up the book and hopefully get caught up in the story. I know I enjoyed it.

There's not a lot of character development, and I wish that the grandfather had somehow gotten more involved with the project. I'm a little surprised this isn't included in the MAX line up.

 I really really enjoyed the first two books but honestly this one really let me down. I did like how dark it was, but the plot was was too repetitive. Parts that were exciting were short and parts that were boring and dull were long. 
 I was also really disappointed in how Emily changed. She started as such a outspoken and strong women, and ended up as a shell of the person she was who let self doubt and other people opinions stop her doing what she wanted to do. It was such a departure from the previous two books and really didn't fit with the character development of the rest of the series. 
 The romance in this made me want to bang my head against the wall. JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER! If they loved each other so much why wouldn't they say something or try to make it work?!? Stupid! Also Emily and Ilse need slaps for doing that to those two boys. Mean is what that was. 
 However I was happy that Emily cast Dean off! He's been a thorn in my side this whole series! He pretty much groomed her from childhood, which was super creepy! Then was so controlling of her when she finally gave up and got with him. What he said about her writing was despicable! 
 I'm glad the ending happened the way that it did, but it was so rushed. It didn't seem real or fleshed out at all. ""Oh Teddy's back! The end!"" Come on I need more than that L. M.. 
 In the end I feel like this was a book written out of obligation and not love. It was pretty poorly done compared to her other works and honestly felt like I was reading a first draft of a novel. I liked that things didn't always work out for the characters and that they weren't always happy. But expressing this could have been done a lot better.

"474",474,"Mallory is thrilled to be taking a ""Short Takes"" class in children's literature, her favorite topic, but to her surprise, the class quickly becomes her least favorite. The class is 100% in-class discussion and participation, and the teacher, a coach, doesn't call on her, even though she raises her hand for most of the class. When she finally does get a chance to talk, he doesn't give her time to think, and she sounds stupid. She theorizes that he is much more lenient with the boys. Meanwhile, she is also finding it difficult to voice her opinions in sixth-grade council meetings, since the president is so cute and the treasurer, a dopey girl, agrees with everything he says and asserts ridiculous opinions such as ""Boys don't like pushy girls."" Mallory discovers an injustice she just can't ignore in the school accounting of past sixth-grade school gifts, and she forces herself to speak up. She then screws up her courage and asks for a meeting with her teacher, where she tells him she's noticed him giving more attention to the boys. He denies being sexist, but she notices him making an effort to be more egalitarian in his next class. 
 Mallory's characterization is extremely problematic in this book; although she's a long-established nerd, admittedly, her problems asserting herself seem out-of-character for the practical, mature, eldest-of-eight we usually know. She seems to be representing The Generic Girl, like someone did a survey of the things girls don't like in school, and just dumped them all on Mallory for one book to make a Point About Sexism In School, which is probably actually how this book was written. The problem is, they DO have a shy, unassertive character who hates being the center of attention and would certainly do poorly in a class-participation centered class, and that is Mary Anne! 
 Lingering Questions: I don't understand how the ""Short Takes"" program works. I understand it's supposed to allow students to take short-term classes in addition to their normal courseload, but how? and when? During study hall? It doesn't seem to be optional, and Mallory says specifically that the topic is the same for everybody, which seems dumb. It would require less coincidence if Mallory had chosen to study children's literature because she likes it so much. And how much worse when she discovers the class she chose is so hateful, and she could have been in a different one. Also, do sixth graders really give school gifts? Since Mallory is super-secretly in college now, I guess it doesn't matter. 
 Timing: April and early May

 I've been dragging my feet about writing this review for some time. I didn't really like it and momma always said, ""If you don't have anything good to say..."" Yet, unfortunately for me I also promised the publisher that I would give an honest review in exchange for the book. 
 So, it comes down to momma going head-to-head verses the Tyndale publishing team. Cage match, live on pay-per-view! 
 But seriously, the premise is that the story is being written by a 10-year-old girl for a school project. And I guess, in that regard you'd call it a success. The rambling, disconnected thoughts, as well as grammatical and spelling mistakes all combine to give it the feel of an elementary school class assignment. 
 Of course there are two sides to that coin. The opposite being: I want to read a good quality book, not some kid's class assignment!!! 
 This 10yo writer's goal is to write a story about something that happened in her life. Intermingled with that she is also learning how to write, so we get little writing tips and suggestions sprinkled throughout. 
 As a homeschooling father I first I thought this could be used as a teaching tool, but as the story progressed I decided the teacher's methodology wasn't the way I would want to do teach it anyway. And, of course, I've already graduated from elementary school (somehow against all odds), so I have a hard time seeing how this information does anything but slow us down. 
 Plot: 
 Laura, the new girl in school, is fat. Really fat. 
 Even in the face of some pretty brutal bullying, she is able to remain sweet and maintain a great positive attitude. 
 Bullying is really what the book is about. It is really where the book shines. It doesn't glorify it, nor does it shame the bullies! Rather, it tells it like it is -- all the emotions, the pain and hurt, as well as the peer pressure aspect. 
 Best of all, it holds a message for the bullies themselves about how they can change. 
 It really is a great book on bullying! 
 I just... don't need a book on bulling. (I homeschool, remember?) 
 Conclusion: 
 This might be good if you need a book about bullying and the general meanness of kids, written in stumbling language that might make it easier for younger children to relate to. 
 If, instead, you're looking for a book to teach creative writing, I'd sooner recommend a more complete dedicated resource such as How to Write (And Sell) A Christian Novel by Gilbert Morris 
 Finally, if none of that applies and you just want a good story to read, well, you know what momma says...

"446",446,"As I have quite a fascination for Irish Mythology I was immediately attracted to this book. The prologue was very promising as it showed Macha and Bodbh appearing in the twentieth century. As the hero, Pidge, is introduced in the first chapter the early promise is maintained for a while. 
 Before long though the clash of magic and modernity kicks in and this I found slightly disappointing. Pidge and Brigit seem too accepting of the bizarre for my liking and I found myself thinking of Masefield's 'Box of Delights'. Not to say that either this or Masefield's books are bad but I expect my real world heroes to be a little more questioning when they come into contact with magic. 
 As the quest really gets going the Masefield comparison seemed to grow stronger. There was also a powerful feeling that the story was happening to Pidge and Brigit, rather than them shaping it though their actions. 
 The conclusion I also found slightly unsatisfactory although I won't say why to avoid spoiling it to anyone who hasn't yet read the book. Despite the criticism though I must say that the treatment of the mythology was excellent.",2,0.059,0,0.977,1.954
"878",878,"I read this book to my kids tonight. Sylvia is 7, Jesse is 3. It explains the details pretty well. The parents make up silly stories, and the kids set them straight by drawing pictures of how babies are really made. The pictures look like kids' drawings, and even though parts are drawn, they are very loosely represented. Sylvia decided the book was ""appropriate"" and that it explained everything well. 
 This book came from my library's ""Family Talk"" section. The section originated because certain children's books in our system were challenged. Rather than removing them, they were put in a special section, on a special shelf that is required to be sixty inches off the ground. That way kids can't accidentally pick them up for themselves. A grown up has to get the book down for them. 
 I've always said I'm not going to censor anything my kids want to read, so this whole special shelf bothers me. However, since I'm not in charge, I can't do much about it. Still, my supervisor and I talked about it, and we decided to move it from the shelf in the back of the children's section to the shelf in the front, next to the Children's Sequoyahs, magazines, and the JFiction new books.

 Oh this book had potential. Zacktastic is written by the same author as the Stella Batts series, so I figured this is going to be good! Zack is a genie. He's also got major OCD, which was quite frankly annoying and giving me a little anxiety myself. But that's my problem! So Zack gets called on his first 'mission', 'request', whatever they call it and had a few boring parts I skipped/skimmed and then by the time it was getting good, the book was just getting to the ending phase. The action parts just weren't that exciting or engaging, perhaps because there was bullying involved and I hate bullying. I felt like the part about his father's death (that we learn about early on) was a foreshadow that this book is meant to be one of a series, just because the author didn't tell us enough yet about the dad. 
 I didn't enjoy this book as much as I was hoping to. I feel like this was geared more towards the boy crowd, and while I love reading those too (hello Artemis and Gregor) if it's well done, Zacktastic just wasn't written well enough for me to give it more than 2 stars (bites).",2,0.025,0.043,-0.927,1.94
"185",185,"Dean Koontz, internationally renowned author of dozens of runaway bestsellers, is the big name associated with Santa's Twin, yet artist Phil Parks emerges as its star. The book's rhythmic verse is entertaining in a mildly naughty way (though never going too far for its young audience), but the imagination and depth of the artwork is extraordinary, running rings around most books awarded Caldecott Medals and Honor citations. Phil Parks works his magic on page after panoramic page, with stunning paintings that capture the feeling of Christmas wonder and mystery. Even if you have no interest in the story, Santa's Twin is worth leafing through purely for its art, a vividly expressive holiday appreciation you won't quickly forget. 
 ""So let's look ahead to the big holiday 
 that's coming, coming, coming our way. 
 I'm sure you know just what day I mean. 
 It's not Easter Sunday, not Halloween. 
 It's not a day to be sad or listless. 
 It's a day of wonder. It's Christmas!"" 
 --Santa's Twin 
 The world has reason to worry this Christmas Eve night. That jolly old elf we're accustomed to seeing soar the skies with his magical reindeer isn't on his regular rounds; a wicked intruder has taken his place, a dead ringer for Santa Claus who breaks into homes and steals the presents given to children, swapping out their desired baubles with disgusting and dangerous substitutes (is anyone else reminded of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas?). Santa's embittered twin has it in his sights to ruin Christmas, framing the real Claus for his twin's misdeeds and setting back yuletide joy a hundred years or more. How will children trust Kris Kringle after he supposedly fills their stockings with gross and revolting substances? But like Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a pair of sisters named Charlotte and Emily catch the ersatz Santa at his mischief. Unlike Cindy Lou Who, Charlotte and Emily overhear Santa's twin muttering about his plan to spoil Christmas forever, and recognize that they're the last line of defense if future merry holidays are to be preserved. Can the girls thwart the intentions of Santa's evil doppelganger and rescue the real St. Nick from his bondage at the North Pole? And is there any way they can pull it off in time to save Christmas this year? 
 There are ""Easter eggs"" throughout Santa's Twin, mostly in the illustrations. On a small bookshelf in the entrance foyer of Charlotte and Emily's house is a copy of Mr. Murder, a 1993 Dean Koontz horror/mystery novel that I've heard contains the beginning verses of Santa's Twin. On main street at the North Pole, the marquee outside the free movie theater advertises that The Bells of St. Mary's is showing. Wouldn't it be fun to watch that Christmas classic in Santa's own village! I also wonder if the names of the two girls, Charlotte and Emily, are a nod to the Bronte sisters. But the best Easter egg, if you can call it one, is the snowman game in the illustrations. At least one snowman is hidden in every shot and readers are challenged to find it, making the book secondarily a game similar to the I Spy works of Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick. Santa's Twin is an interesting picture book, different from any other children's holiday fare I've encountered, and I'd definitely give it one and a half stars. If you're into offbeat Christmas treats to sweeten your December merriment, Santa's Twin might be the fix you seek.",1,0.089,0.018,0.987,1.938
"223",223,"I found this displayed on the new book shelf of my town library and thought I'd take a look. The cover illustration was appealing and there have been some excellent yoga for kids books published in the last year, so I picked it up to take a look. Alas, this is not excellent. At first I thought, ""Yoga at the zoo!?"" Then, I googled yoga at the zoo and, apparently, it's a thing. Okay, cool. 
 I suppose that somewhere along the line kids do need to learn that yoga means ""union of the mind and heart"" and that it is an ancient philosophy from India. Yes, the word philosophy is explained. 
 The boy in the story goes home to practice with his cat. The lion pose was innocuous enough but the second pose is tortoise. What? Really? I know kids are flexible, but tortoise is rather advanced. It's not really a pose for the beginning of a practice when you are not warmed up and there are steps to get into the pose in order to avoid injury. Try to touch the feet with the head? That's it? Please! To top that off - the illustration is wrong. There are lots of variations of yoga poses (as I learned when I disagreed with the description of crocodile). In tortoise, I always learned that the arms go under the legs from the inside. I did not find one image showing it the way the illustrator depicts the pose. 
 The author is a yoga teacher and the flap states that she teaches kids. If she was intending a cute little book comparing poses to animals, she succeeded. If she intended the sequence of animals poses to be a suggested practice, she didn't. I fear that some misguided, non-yoga practicing parent might try doing these poses with their younglings and both might get injured. Ditto for camel - so many ways to hurt your back if you are not careful about getting in and out of that pose and it's definitely not one to do if you're not warmed up. 
 Finally, while I realize that this book chose animal poses for appeal, if you are going to insist that young yogis learn the philosophy, how can you not include savasana as a final pose? Granted, you can't make an animal connection but one does not generally end one's practice of yoga without releasing one's practice. 
 The creamy illustrations are quite lovely but not enough for me to recommend this book.",1,0.105,-0.04,0.926,1.932
"357",357,"To start, I couldn't stand the whiny, gravely voice that the reader used for August. It drove me nuts. It was a relief when another character section would start. I mean, from a directing standpoint, I think if you're trying to show how, other than his facial deformity, Auggie is just like other kids, why make him have such a baby voice? I was expecting a lot more from this audiobook. 
 The story itself was okay. Engaging, but a bit heavy-handed. I understand that the book was aiming for the message ""choose kind"" (especially since I have a button that says this from the publisher), but it really just seemed to suggest that if you wait out cruelty and bullying, people will start to you think you are really amazing instead. I was kind of disgusted at the end to find out that the principal knew the extent of the bullying (a lot of which was just skimmed over in the narrative, actually, like the hateful notes) and didn't do anything about it. Well, of course, later he used it to make a speech at a 5th/6th grade commencement ceremony (???? Sidenote: What kind of school has a big commencement for every single kid who moves up a grade? This ridiculousness is only explained by the author's need to have a grand finale, a big preachy speech, and a standing ovation for Auggie). It also really bothered me how August's mother CONSTANTLY commented to him about how other kids looked. ""Is she pretty?"" ""She's pretty."" It seemed pretty contrary to the message of the book. 
 The best parts of the book were August's relationships with Daisy, his dog, and his father.",2,0.105,-0.043,0.915,1.916
"334",334,"I got an Advanced Reading Copy through the Amazon Vine program. It sounded like a fun story, but was a complete dud. I don't know if the story just didn't translate well or what, but as short as it was it was a struggle to get through. I've given one star to maybe three books in the hundreds and hundreds that I have reviewed...and this is a one star book. 
 Kat is afraid of swimming. Her parents take her to an island on vacation with the intent of teaching her how to swim. While there Kat finds a magic whistle and finds that she is destined to defeat a horrible curse put on the island by a villainous toad. Will Kat be able to set aside her fear of swimming long enough the save the island? 
 I am trying to think about positive things about this book and am having trouble. I guess it is kind of creative and had potential to be a fantastic story if you consider the general idea. The idea of a girl running into a dolphin who is a Water Knight is interesting, yet we didn't get to see much of the Water Knight in the story. 
 First let's talk about the awkwardness of the writing. The writing does not flow, it is fractured and simple. Kat sounds more like a simpleton than a little girl throughout the book. I don't know if the book was poorly translated or what, but it was horrible. At 100 pages long this should have been a cinch to read, but it was a struggle. It was one of those books where I just kept shaking my head and thinking ""did anyone actually read this before it was printed?"" Seriously I want the hour that it took to read this book back. 
 Kat's hilarious father is just annoying. Kat spends time dwelling on the Americaness of things on the island (bright water toys, loud tourists) but she is American and is on a Spanish speaking island; it comes off as confusing and odd. Kat makes a number of decisions that don't seem to fit with her characters and don't make a lot of sense. All of the characters are mere sketches, none of them are that interesting. There is a lot of Spanish in the book and it is translated, I guess it might help your kid learn a few Spanish phrases but mostly it was just obnoxious. 
 Now let's talk about the numerous inconsistencies in the story. At one point Kat talks about how mosquitoes sting people...umm okay but being from Minnesota this was a glaring error...they bite, they don't sting. Then there is the man Kat meets with webbing up to the tips of his fingers...guess what he wears gloves all the time. The author explicitly described the webbing and how it goes to the very tips of his fingers and then spends time talking about his gloves. Ummm...okay..how do you get gloves on webbed hands? This is talked about multiple times in the story and it annoyed the stuffing out of me...maybe the webbing is really loose and he tucks it down between his fingers? I am not sure why this bothered me so much...it just didn't make sense. 
 Lastly lets discuss the final epic (or actually pretty non-epic) battle between Kat and the evil toad. First of all Kat suddenly becomes one with the water and can swim after all the time of not being able to swim even a stroke. Next she swims into an underground cave and (not only stays down there forever) but can talk down there and walk around. So suddenly not only can Kat swim like a fish, she can breath underwater, stay under water indefinitely, and walk around. Why is this? As a reader we will never know. I read it through multiple times and couldn't figure out if it was the magic whistle, the Water Knight, or maybe just that the stars were aligned correctly. By the end of the story I had no idea what had happened...honestly though I didn't really care, I just heaved a breath of relief that I was done reading the most horrible book I have read this year so far (I've read 154 book this year so far so that is saying something). 
 Overall just a horrible book. Poorly written, poorly edited, awkward language, an inconsistent plot, and dull characters. The writing level might challenge a five year old but any older children will be bored. The only interesting parts, where Kat interacts with the dolphin, are very brief. Please don't let your child read this book, they may never want to read again. Especially a middle grade reader. Get them something wonderful and magical like Harry Potter, Percy and the Olympians, The Warriors, or Fablehaven. I can't believe this book is targeted at that age group and I can't believe that it is in print. I almost never give one star reviews for books since for me that requires horrible editing, glaring errors, and an atrocious plot and characters...this book is the exception though, it had it all and not in a good way.",1,-0.038,-0.159,-0.992,1.908
"564",564,"The Mysterious Benedict Society starts with our introduction to Reynard ""Reynie"" Muldoon, an 11 year old orphan of abnormal intelligence. Mocked and bullied by his fellow orphans at the orphanage in which he resides, Reynie is excited by an ad he reads in the paper calling for gifted students to come take tests which could get them admitted into a special program. After showing up and passing the tests, Reynie meets three other children that also passed the tests (Kate, Sticky and Constance) and Mr. Benedict, the person responsible for the test. According to Mr. Benedict, the Emergency (basically a bad thing going on across the world) was being caused by a man known as Ledroptha Curtain, and he was somehow using other children to send out telepathic messages with a machine he'd created. The only way to stop him was to send a group of children to the school Mr. Curtain had created to locate likely candidates for his telepathic project as spies. 
 The story was interesting, and while I did really enjoy it, it definitely dragged at places. About halfway through I basically had to just force myself to read the next couple of chapters, but I'm glad I did because it picked back up in the last third and had a pretty good ending. A few of the ""twists"" were fairly obvious, most of which will be seen by the reader pretty quickly, but at least one of them was not what I was expecting. In addition to the dragging plot, it was a bit hard to get over some of the clues the supposedly gifted children had trouble figuring out. I guess some of it can be attributed to the fact that these books are targeted at a younger audience, but some of the things were just really hard to look past. 
 The characters made the story, and all four children definitely grew on me. Reynie was a problem solver, Sticky had a photographic memory, Kate was a carny with a bucket full of tools she never left home without, and Constance was very very stubborn. I'm sure everyone has their own favorite and mine was Kate (she was just so resourceful!!), but the other three all had their own strengths and all four each got their own moment to play a big part. 
 I'm going to give this story a 3.5 out of 5, because I did enjoy the story. This book is actually the first of what appears to be a trilogy and I'm not adverse to reading the rest, but for now the story is adequately resolved for me. I would recommend this story to anyone interested in middle grade fiction with the warning that the middle of the book does get a bit slow!",3,0.037,0.05,0.99,1.906
"176",176,"Everyone want to know what lesson I learned? I learned that it's okay to be a rude, snotty, obnoxious brat when you're a kid as long as you plan to be well mannered when you grow up. 
 ***Can you hear my applause for Ziefert?*** 
 This is in my top three of worst children's books EVER. The ""story"" (it doesn't even deserve that credit IMO) starts with two seemingly well behaved children sitting on a couch with their parents standing behind them. 
 And then. The story says what the children will do when they grow up. As in, ""I'll be so polite."" and ""I'll always say please."" 
 Mind, while they story is telling the reader what the kids will do as adults, the kids are shoving each other trying to take a bike. Stealing a helmet from the sibling. Answering the phone like a brat, barging in bathrooms announced, not waiting in line, not taking turns, losing tempers and yelling at people and sitting their lazy ass on a bus seat while an older woman with groceries stands in the aisle. The illustrations depict the kids slamming doors in people's faces (not maliciously but just ignoring anyone but themselves), blowing their nose over food on the dinner table, playing with their food, throwing food in the air to the dog, taking bowls while saying 'gimme that', burping at the dinner table, leaving without saying a word, saying rude things to people, need I go on? I think I've mentioned most of the behavior that if it coming from MY daughter would quickly result in punishment. 
 I feel the need to say that anyone can ask anyone else who knows me about what kind of parent I am. I'm a great Mom. I'm a terrific Mom. Honestly, I'm one of the best Moms on this planet we live on. My daughter, who is almost 6, does not walk all over me. She has manners and she behaves. She knows nothing less will be tolerated. She has melt-downs. Who doesn't? And there is leeway for that of course. She has bad days, as do I, and those are taken into account to. But rude behavior and what is shown in this book is not tolerated here. Why? Because I don't let it. 
 We were recently invited to a wedding for adults only. We were called separately and told Julia (my daughter) was more than welcome to come. They put 'adults only' on the invitation because of the other kids and because they didn't want them misbehaving. They know Julia wouldn't. 
 This type of behavior and lack of parenting is why kids walk all over their parents today. It's why I see kids hitting their parents and the parents do nothing. It's why I see kids demanding - actually demanding! - things be bought for them. And what happens? Whatever it is is bought. I've heard kids speak to their parents in ways I wouldn't ever dream of talking to mine. Because my Mom would knock me on my ass. And for that (among other things of course), she's always gotten respect. 
 Now, this book isn't responsible for all this of course, but is it helping? If anything it's hurting. Do we really need a book on how to be a terrorist and make bombs? Even if we put some words in there saying it's bad - don't do it? This doesn't even have that! The ending is like so: ""But for now, we're just kids!"" As if being kids makes it all okay. They're allowed to act like that! They're ""just kids""! 
 This may be a bit drastic but I mean it so I'll say it, the author, Harriet Ziefert, should be ashamed of herself. And actually, the illustrator, Chris Demarest, as well for even jumping on board after seeing this mess. There are too many subjects out there and too many ways to take a different stand on each. There's no reason to send out a clear message that it's okay to be a snotty, obnoxious brat because you're a kid. 
 I also want to point out that Julia told me, numerous times, that she'd never act like that. I told her that I have no doubt about that, that she never acts like these kids in the book. But it struck me that she even saw such a difference in herself and her actions against these characters and their actions.",1,-0.025,-0.082,-0.976,1.902

"668",668,"Children's books help young readers to understand the world, and not just the world that they know. Stories teach them about different lifestyles, cultures, and customs from around the world. Author Segilola Salami has provided young readers with a tale written in both Yoruba and English to expose them to a different culture but also to teach a universal lesson about the love between mothers and children in her new book, Yetunde: An Ode to My Mother. 
 Yetunde is a young child from African descendants growing up in England. During the course of the story, she listens to her mother tell an African folktale which doubles as a family history. Her mother's story is very dark, filled with death and sadness about the loss of Yetunde's grandmother. Yetunde is as understanding a listener as she is a naive narrator, pulling off both roles despite her young age. She is a very unique character in that she is only nine months old and not able to express herself well verbally. She is still very confused about the world with the added complication of learning both English and her mother's African language, Yoruba. 
 African customs and traditions are also highlighted and explained within the story. Salami is very aware of an English-speaking audience's ignorance towards such customs, even adult readers, and she is careful to explain unique words and practices to the reader. She also throws in more familiar references for an English audience, sidetracking to mention them specifically, such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, connecting the show to the story she is telling to help make it more relevant to the reader. 
 There is also the fantasy element to the story within the story, featuring a water god who plays an integral part in the parable. This water element represents motherhood, the central theme running through the story and shows how far a mother will go for her child, stating: ""water has no enemy. Anyone who tries to fight with water has doomed himself."" The events turn terribly dark at points, trusting the readers of all ages to be able to handle these scary elements, from kidnapping to fantasy violence to personal loss. 
 Salami holds nothing back in order to tell her tale, showing that mothers cannot protect their children from the world, but they will fight for their safety, and children should arm themselves with knowledge of the world so that they can be aware of danger and use their mothers' parables as more than a simple bedtime story. I like the idea of keeping children in the loop with the ways of the world, mixing the good with the bad. The world is a scary place, and the better you are at identifying evil, the more likely you will be able to stay away from, or at least ahead of it, another central theme in the book. 
 This is the third book that Salami has written featuring Yetunde. Without giving too much away, this Yetunde story ends on a cliffhanger, paving the way for future books. As Yetunde learns and develops, she teeters between a traditional African heritage and a modern English lifestyle, and as she begins to be able to express herself verbally in both languages, Yetunde is constantly taking in information from both perspectives, making her well rounded and open to multiple cultures and what they can teach you.",3,-0.133,-0.043,-0.989,1.892

(I deplore the stupid 'raked' book edgings the publishing industry is foisting on us readers these days - can't grab a page to save your life and, contrary to their misguided ideas, it DOES NOT give a book a graceful older aged feeling. It's just dumb). Sorry. Ranting. Feel moderately better now. 
 Anyways - the book presentation is really wonderful. I also like the black satin ribbon page marker too. A nice touch. That way, no one should have to bend down a corner to mark a page (I won't rant on about this, I promise .....you know who you are). 
 The story was definitely aimed at a slightly younger - and I'll say, female - audience. The protagonist is a young girl, Ada Goth, living in a crazy eclectic massive home (more like a residential Hogwarts) surrounded by quite a group of eccentric people that flit in and out of her existence. Her mother died long ago in an unfortunate tight rope walking accident and her father is still in grieving, especially all the more so when he glimpses his daughter as she's the spitting image of the woman he loved - so Ada is left alone a lot. 
 Our first introduction to Ada and her world is when she meets a ghost of a mouse and they get to talking. He's quite sad, just discovering that he's - well - dead. Doesn't know what happened or why. So they set off to his last known location and that sets the whole adventure in motion. We get introductions to all sorts of wonderfully odd people that inhabit the house, either as guests or servants or new found friends and - although the words are somewhat lacking, the illustrations of said characters are beyond splendid. It left a lot to your imagination as to how the place all linked together, but you had a good solid ideas as to how everyone should look. Top stars for that!

"215",215,"Well that was a surprise. 
 I remember loving these stories when I was a child, and have fond memories of my father reading them to me at bedtime. But I became increasingly uneasy as I read through most of these 22 tales. Brer Rabbit was a trickster, yes, but he was far from the mischievous impish, lovable rogue of my memory. This Brer Rabbit was conniving and mean-spirited. He revelled in inventing devious plots to make his enemies look ridiculous - and even worse - manipulated his friends. Of course his natural enemies were Brer Fox, Brer Wolf and Brer Bear ... but in these stories, Brer Rabbit seemed to take a positive delight in deception; pretending to be their friend, and then craftily manipulating circumstances. Brer Fox, Brer Wolf or Brer Bear would without fail be left in a humiliating situation, needing to be rescued. These did not seem to be simple stories of courage or survival. Something else was encoded here. What was the story behind Joel Chandler Harris? 
 A little research showed me that Joel Chandler Harris collected many of these stories at the end of the 19th century. Brer Rabbit did indeed represent a trickster figure, which had originated in African folklore. When the stories were transmitted by African slaves to the New World, they there acquired additional attributes of similar native American tricksters, and a new character was born. Joel Chandler Harris fleshed him out into Brer, or Brother, Rabbit, and in retelling many of his adventures, he gave them a potent and contemporary significant message. Brer Rabbit embodies the idea which is universal among oppressed peoples--that a small, weak, but intelligent and clever force can overcome a larger, stronger, but dull-witted one. Hence, Brer Rabbit always outsmarts his natural enemies, Brer Fox, Brer Wolf, and Brer Bear. 
 A worthy message indeed. Perhaps there are better retellings of these stories - or perhaps this is a case of needing to look at the original stories. I originally added a star for the skilled way in which Phyllis Briggs kept the original vernacular within the speech of the animals, whilst retelling the main text of the story in standard English. She also conveyed a sense of the plantation in Georgia, where the stories are set. But I swiftly removed the star for the horribly mismatched illustrations. 
 These are twee animal pictures by E.H. Davie; simple line drawings with block colours in either red, orange, blue or green. In another book they would be delightful, and indeed, I have seen this illustrator's work in a more appropriate context. But here, the openfaced rabbit in the pictures just does not represent the character we are reading about. He is not this fresh-faced innocent, this lovable little scamp who is ""just playing"" and doesn't mean any harm. So does he work as an anti-hero, then? Not for me. 
 No, this Brer Rabbit is a spiteful mean character, who most certainly does mean harm, and is out for his own ends. Even appreciating the context in which they were written, one would need to be very careful in telling them to any youngsters today, without a little explanation.

 Also - the book was unnecessarily depressing. What could have been a single well-worded paragraph became 100 pages of slogging through hopelessness.

"171",171,"Someone once defined a literary classic as a book that everyone wants to have read, but no-one actually wants to read. 
 A clever line, yes, but essentially flawed in that most classic books from Austen to Dickens and Hardy to Hugo deserve their classic status and offer rich rewards for anyone who reads them. 
 Perhaps, I wonder, the writer of that line had just finished reading Swallows And Amazons. 
 For while it's undeniably a classic and has been enjoyed, allegedly, by millions since first publication in 1930, I found it to be one of the dullest books I've read for quite some time. 
 My 11-year-old daughter and I took turns reading Swallows And Amazons as it was on the reading list for the grammar school she's about to go to. 
 Its main failing is that Arthur Ransome - a journalist who really ought to have known better - delighted in using every example of nautical terminology he could think of. 
 He couldn't call a spade a spade, or even a rope a rope. No, it had to be a sheet, or a painter. And while those distinctions might well be vital for anyone who is actually sailing a boat, it's downright distracting, and utterly boring, for general readers who want to enjoy a story without having to look up half a dozen words in every paragraph in order to have the slightest idea of what the author is talking about. 
 We could all do that, showing off our specialist knowledge by using obscure jargon instead of simple English, but readers wouldn't thank us for it. 
 Ransome's original editor should have sat him down and told him to rewrite it, dropping the nautical terminology and using, instead, ordinary words that would be understood by landlubbers and wouldn't put a spanner in the works of every other sentence. 
 There is nothing wrong with jargon, in the right place. But Ransome wasn't writing a sailing manual in which all of those words for rope, and more, would have been essential; he was writing an adventure story for children, and it's hard to imagine how many of them must have been bored out of their minds down the generations by the tedious task of ploughing through this book. 
 His failure is all the more remarkable because Ransome was a journalist before he became a novelist. Journalists are taught to communicate clearly, using plain words that most of their readers will be able to understand, and that to lose a reader by writing in unpenetrable jargon is unforgiveable. 
 That apart, the story is a rather thin one that he manages to stretch into a rather fat book (374 pages). It's a charming enough story, about some children living alone on an island, but pales into insignificance in comparison with, say, Enid Blyton's adventure stories. 
 Several of her books also involved children living alone on islands, but they were pacey, exciting, and appealed to young readers so much that they couldn't put them down. 
 She was writing at much the same time, but never bored her readers, didn't stuff her books with jargon, and became the J K Rowling of her day. 
 My daughter, an avid reader, found it hard to pick up Swallows And Amazons after the first few sessions and came up with one excuse after another to avoid reading - yet she devoured the whole of Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo in a single day and said excitedly afterwards that she wished it could have gone on and on. 
 Whereas Swallows And Amazons, unfortunately, did go on and on...and on. 
 Many will see this review as heretical, no doubt, but I wonder if there are many others who have also devoted a part of their lives to reading this book that they'll never get back. 
 Or could it be that, like women telling expectant mothers that childbirth doesn't hurt, readers who've suffered all 374 pages of this book themselves don't see why they should protect other people from the surprise of discovering what it's really like?",1,0.082,0.206,0.996,1.828

 April 12th 2016 by Walden Pond Press 
 ARC from Young Adult Books Central 
 John and his sister Page are living with their great aunt Beauregarde after the death of their parents in the grimy and depressing town of Pludgett. John works for the family business, building coffins, but he has managed to keep Page in school. When Beauregarde tells the two that Page will start working for Coggin Family Coffins, the two decide to run away. Luckily, they have just bet Boz, and odd man who is associated with the Wandering Wayfarers circus, and he arrives just in time to drive them away from their aunt in a horse drawn fire engine. The two find the circus amusing, and John works hard to earn acceptance by the group by working on a steam driven vehicle called the Autopsy, but he is never able to make it work, and soon he and Page are on their own again. Luckily, they manage to find Maria, who runs a bakery and takes a liking to both of them. She puts John to work, but her nephew soon arrives and realizes that money is very tight. In order to help, John tries to create a new oven, but his efforts wind up blowing up the bakery! On the run again, they join up with an archaeologist, Miss Doyle, but are soon located by their great aunt and kidnapped. With the help of Boz, as well as others he has met on his journeys, John tries to create a vehicle that will steal the show at the Pludgett Day celebration and win his freedom and that of his sister. 
 There are plenty of goofy moments in this book-- John is referred to as Dung Boy in the circus, since he first meets most of the performers after stepping in a horse patty, chicken poo is used for fuel for John's engines, and there are a lot of small, gross moments where boogers drop from people's noses into their soup. 
 While Beauregard is nothing but evil, John and Page are fortunate enough to find a variey of caring people to help them. I loved Maria and the scenes in the bakery; it was somewhat reminiscent of the scene in The Box Car Children. If I were running away from home and hungry, I would certainly look for an alley to sleep in very close to a bakery. It was especially nice that Maria came looking for the children even after they burned her business to the ground. 
 Like Ardagh's Eddie Dickens Trilogy, Wood's The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place, or Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, The Mechanical Mind of John Coggins pits orphaned children against a variety of evil adults who think nothing of sacrificing them for an evil agenda. Using language much like Snicket's, in that the vocabulary is rather rarified and obscure, Teele draws a quirky, dangerous world full of intrigue and adventure for her hapless but resourceful characters.

 I really don't understand why this book has so many glowing reviews. It's just a total mess, as far as I'm concerned. The dystopia Lowry creates makes absolutely no sense on a number of levels. The biggest issue I had is: how the hell does the protagonist never realize that Release is euthanasia until it's shown to him? It's such an obvious and easy thing to figure out, and it's incredibly boring and frustrating that the book treats it like a big surprise. A lot of other setting details make little sense. For example, the idea of weather control and having remade the world is quickly negated by what Jonas finds after he leaves his community. In general, the dystopia feels like a hyper-exaggerated version of Soviet Russia or Communist China that doesn't stand up under scrutiny and just constantly makes me shake my head at how ridiculous it is. The plot itself is threadbare and hardly interesting. It fails to stand with the complex world and interesting moral dilemmas of classic dystopias like 1984 and lacks the action adventure and powerful women of The Hunger Games and other modern YA dystopias. 
 I will say that there are some neat elements here. The idea of most people in the dystopia not being able to see color is neat, especially because it avoids the all to common and ableist cliche of having people be blind to things by being literally blind. Plus, the Giver himself is kinda cool - somebody who holds onto the collective memory of humanity and acts as a sort of emotional center for the community. Of course, even these elements make very little sense, but without them, I would likely have gained no enjoyment at all from reading this. Apparently there are three more books in this series, but they're only tenuously connected and I don't think I care enough to find out how Lowry resolves the ambiguous ending - which is one of the few things about this book that isn't necessarily totally awful.

 On Memorial Day I remembered that this story opened on Decoration Day as it was called back then, in 1912. Just a few years after the Spanish American War and before WWI. 
 Emily is one of three books Lovelace wrote after the Betsy- Tacy Series ended. Carney's House Party and Winona's Pony Cart have all been out of print since the 60's. 
 I found Emily tucked away in the public library in 9th grade and quickly discovered that my favorite characters were mere footnotes in this story. I recall being disappointed and did not appreciate that the book was meant to be a judged as a stand alone story. 
 Re-reading Emily of Deep Valley the other day, I was struck by the author's maturity as she wrote this story. Emily is in some ways, Betsy's darker self. Emily and her friends are graduating from Deep Valley High. Emily is popular but one of the quieter, brainy girls similar to Alice, Betsy and Tacy's friend, whom Betsy snubs for most of her junior year as she gets caught up in the sorority-fraternity cliques she helped create. 
 Emily loves to read, she is a deep thinker, but she is unable to go to college because she feels she cannot leave her elderly grandfather with whom she lives alone. Her popular cousin Annette goes off to the U and Emily is left in Deep Valley alone and depressed. 
 Lovelace acknowledges depression in both Emily and in the boy Emily has crushed in high school, the mercurial Don. Both Emily and Don are drawn to each other, perhaps noting this in each other. Emily is aware of her dark moods and seeks to find a way out of the blues by updating her hair, starting a book club with Miss Fowler and eventually helping the people who live in Little Syria beyond her home, with the help of her grandfather and Jed the new coach at Deep Valley High. 
 It's written by a more mature Lovelace, and presents a more complex main character. Emily is modeling herself on Jane Addams of Hull House, and the message is the same as the Betsy-Tacy Books: women can paddle their own canoes, but it's nice to find a man who appreciates your drive and independence, too.",4,0.01,0.185,0.9,1.78

"207",207,"Normally, I adore stories with Sendak illustrations. They feature the charm of children who never quite grow up and operate as free from the grown-up world as they can. But this one left me feeling rather sour. While the illustrations are a delight, I didn't like the story at all. 
 The titular character is an organ grinder who plays for money. Two children take a dislike to him, apparently for no other reason than that people will play him for his tunes and will not pay them. In retaliation, they imitate bears and attack him. The crowd then turns on them and Brundibar immediately counter-attacks in the only way he knows how--through biting commentary in the form of a song. 
 Unhappy, the children then turn to a bunch of other children and animals to lift their voices in song. The fickle crowd that had turned on them now pelts them with money, enough for the original two children to buy the milk their sick mother needed. However, not content with this, they round on Brundibar and call him a bully (Why? Because he made money? Or because he wouldn't give any of it to the little urchins who'd attacked him?) and the animals pounce on him. The crowd, once again showing how easily they are led, trail after Brundibar, calling him names, allowing animals to attack him and demanding back their money that they freely gave him. 
 It was not the children I felt sorry for but Brundibar himself, unfairly attacked by the very crowd that had lauded him, mauled by vicious beasts and maligned by nasty children. If Brundibar does return, I hope it's with a huge orchestra. Then he can find those awful kids and play outside their home until their eardrums shatter.",1,-0.07,-0.4,-0.955,1.77
"273",273,"This really should be an innocuous little book. A cute little book to read to your favourite baby just before they go to bed at night. A book to bring a smile to your face, not just your child's. It's not selling any toys, not a piece of propaganda fluff for Hollywood animation, not a work that goes out of its way to entrench gender stereotypes, not a work that espouses a particular world view. It is a nice little book, and it should pass the time, then be easily forgotten as you tickle your baby's brains out. 
 So why did I hate it so damn much?! 
 I am asking myself that question, and I feel like my answer is inadequate. I know a big part of my disdain comes from the fact that the cute little dog -- who really plays the role of a child with the little girl as Mother -- is an ungrateful little attention seeker, who nearly destroys her little girl's debut as Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz in a spiteful little attention grab. Dixie steals Emma's ruby slippers, and hides them under the bed. She's a vengeful little bitch (which I believe is the accurate term in this case), and I wanted Emma to take her to an obedience course in the next book (instead, I think she's rewarded with a trip to school pet day). 
 I think it aggravates me so much because the story takes place from the dog's POV. We're practically in the mind of the dog, and we are supposed to sympathize with Dixie's situation. Oh, poooooor, Dixie. Her little girl isn't spending enough time with her :( I can't, though. Dixie's a spoiled brat. She pisses me off. But is that enough to hate this book? Is it fair? I dunno. I just know that I do.

"274",274,"This book is a good case study of what it's like when a gamebook writer elects not to place much importance on the concept of internal consistency; meaning, the fundamental action of the plot often changes, depending on what choices you make, in ways that should not realistically be affected by your decisions. For example, in Escape from Horror House, depending on what you decide to do, the cause behind the poltergeist(s) invading your home will drastically differ. Some gamebook readers don't like this because it affects the stability of the solid story structure and seems unrealistic, while others just shrug it off as something often associated with the genre. Personally speaking, I like to read books of either ""school"". 
 Unlike many of the Give Yourself Goosebumps books written by R.L. Stine, Escape from Horror House doesn't really have any unusual tricks up its sleeve. The books in this series have often been known for their creative complexity in designing choices that seem to break the fourth wall a bit, the kind of decisions that rarely, if ever, pop up in your typical gamebook. Declining to go that route in Escape from Horror House is fine, though I do miss the innovation of some of those earlier Give Yourself Goosebumps books. 
 Basically, the Escape from Horror House story is about a presumed poltergeist that has set up residence in your family's home, destroying things around the house and getting you blamed for the aimless destruction. You've been strictly punished by your mother for what she thinks you've done, and now you're becoming desperate to prove that a malevolent outside force is actually behind the menacing events at your house. 
 There is more than one legitimate way that you can go about trying to prove that a poltergeist has set up shop in your home, but what will dictate success in the long run, more often than not, is whether or not your choices are ruled by a logical, level head. Though not always the case in the book, just like in real life bad choices tend to lead to bad results (and perhaps a decline in quality of future decision options), and good choices trend toward positive results, and an increased spectrum of possible good choices. If you're able to reach an undeniably happy ending in Escape from Horror House, you'll have earned your way. 
 This might not be one of R.L. Stine's more gripping or provocative scary stories, but it's a fun book to read, and making the decisions is an enjoyable experience. I would most likely give one and a half stars to Escape from Horror House.",1,0.063,-0.02,0.865,1.77
"782",782,"Nicholas Benedict is an orphan who knows a lot. But his new life in a new orphanage is about to teach him a whole lot more. 
 At first it's pretty much the same old--strict directors, mean bullies, avoidance by the other kids. But then he discovers something he hasn't encountered at previous orphanages--two unlikely friends, and a chance to find a treasure! The mysterious legend of the lost inheritance of the Rothschilds, the previous owners of the mansion-turned-orphanage, has set not a few off on a fruitless search. But Nick, with his genius mind and problem-solving skills, is about to change that. 
 But not only does Nicholas have to contend with unreasonable yet perfectly predictable bullies, he must avoid and outwit the orphanage director who's also got his sights set on the missing inheritance. His only ally in the endeavor is the good-hearted, loyal John. The boys are joined by a perceptive deaf girl named Violet on a midnight investigation trip up into the hills. This unlikely trio pursues the treasure each for their own reasons. Nicholas passionately seeks a way a out of his endless orphanage lifecycle, John still grieves the recent loss of his parents and desires friendship, and Violet's art school dreams are being threatened by hard financial times on her family's farm. 
 The hurried sense of mystery and edge-of-your-seat thrills that were present in both The Mysterious Benedict Society and The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma are not so driving in this book, though it is interesting to figure out the clues with Nick and his friends. Hidden journal pages, a love of books, sumptuous libraries, midnight hikes up the hillside, a decrepit observatory under the night stars, and the comfort of friends lend a cozy serenity. More is done in the nights than in the days, and the nocturnal doings lend a fresh, exciting feel. 
 But it's more than treasure that Nick encounters in this story. It's heart. He becomes the man he does because of what he goes through during these weeks. He expands his knowledge exponentially in the Rothschild personal library. He uses and develops mechanical skills tinkering with the years-old parts and junk in the basement. He's able to provide a lasting fix to the plague of the place's bullies. But most importantly, he becomes Mr. Benedict. The man who has a heart to help others. 
 Not having experienced much love in his life, Nicholas is somewhat of an expert in the school of hard knocks, and that, coupled with his mental acuity, makes him a formidable force. He doesn't lose that sense of passion, but he does gain a much-needed understanding of companionship and love by meeting the people he does on this venture. This gives him hope for humanity, and the drive to protect the helpless and give opportunities for people to become their best, which is what we see him doing in the ""Mysterious Benedict Society"" books.",4,0.181,0.114,0.998,1.768

 I saw the cover and read in insert and thought it would be a perfect fit for my aesthetics. However, I was very disappointed with this book. 
 I am truly amazed this book managed to slide off of an editors desk. 
 It is in serious need of editing. Not small edits. BIG edits. 
 The most unpleasant thing about this book is it's narration. It is all tell and no show. Chapters go by with the author telling you what happens and very little interaction or dialogue is present, making it very difficult to connect with the characters or the stories. Then we have the overwhealming amoung of long, descriptive sentences that slow down the pacing. Additionally, the main two characters have little character growth. The book was far too long and needed to be shortened. The author could have said the same thing in much less words and it would have made for a stronger book. 
 Reading this book was so tedious, that I was unable to finish it. It didn't hold my attention and didn't move. My eyes continued to glaze over the endless blocks of narration. It became too much. It just wasn't enjoyable. So only a few chapters shy of the ending, I set it aside and said farewell. 
 I cannot reccomend this book. There are a wealth of other similar titles out there that are carried by a stronger voice.",1,0.147,0,0.876,1.752
"244",244,"I read this book because one of my students recommended it, saying it was the best book she's ever read. I wish she hadn't moved so I could ask her what she meant. I mean, was it the only book she's ever read? Because to be the 'best book' on some one's list, it must be a very short list of books read. So as not to beat around the bush, I hated it. The book isn't nearly as mysterious as it is absolutely ridiculous. 
 The book centers around a group of children-Reymie, Sticky and Constance-who each pass a test in order to be accepted in a special school, known as 'The Mysterious Benedict Society'. Each of them has a special talent of some kind. Constance's talent is to be extremely rude if that lets you know how amazing their talents are. That took up about half of the 400 pages. 
 The other half of the book is a quasi-adventure whereby these orphaned misfits team up to defeat Mr. Benedict's evil, long-lost twin brother who is brainwashing the youth of America into being obedient creatures though subliminal messages on TV and the radio that also robs them of their happiness. Much like the feeling I experienced reading this book. 
 Stewart has a writing style, and many other plot similarities, to Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Alas for him, none are portrayed as skillfully as Snickett.

"582",582,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a young adult fiction novel playing on the idea of the future as a placid, if somewhat sterile, community-minded environment. Jonas is a 12 year old boy and a part of a family who share their 'feelings' in an after-dinner meeting, living in a society where there is no pain, no crime, no hunger. Each memeber of society, at their coming-of-age, is assigned a social role by a panel of elders, a decision based on years of monitoring the behaviour, skills, and unique talents/ abilities of each member. Jonas is given a very special almost one-of-a-kind contribution - that of a Receiver. The Receiver is the person chosen to receive the memories of the past and the future from the former Receiver, an Elder known only as the Giver. Jonas is given the burden of experiencing happiness, colours, and even pain, shouldering what the rest of the society has no comprehension of in their sterile, secure environment. 
 As Jonas gains more and more memories, and more experiences, he begins to question himself and his world, realising what he has been missing. Jonas sets out to re-educate his world, but are they ready, or able, to handle what Jonas has seen? 
 The Giver is a book which is deeply philosophical. It presents its ideas in a simple and straightforward fashion, however, which lends force to its meaning for younger readers. I loved the characters of Lily and Gabrielle (Jonas' younger siblings), and I loved the protectiveness and all-encompassing love of Jonas for Gabrielle, as if Gabrielle symbolised the possibilities of future knowledge for Jonas, as well as simply being his innocent little brother. This is a good story for younger people who want to open their minds to the possibility of the 'perfect world' that may not in fact be so perfect.

 Mrs. Frisby (whom is always referred to as such, or as Jonathon Frisby's wife) is faring pretty well with her four children since her husband's mysterious death. she sees a lot of the mouse Jonathon was in her children, especially Timothy (the youngest) - so it is especially tough when he is taken violently ill with pneumonia. her journey to make Timothy well, and to move her family safely away from the impending doom of the tractor, is her motivation throughout this story. she finds help from several sources, but most interesting and crucial is the help from the rats that she receives. not only this, but we learn the history of these mysterious rats, what they're up to, and where they came from (hint - NIMH). 
 i LOVED the movie as a kid, and probably averaged watching it 5-8 times a week. however, the book was refreshingly different from the movie (though i won't get into that here). the intelligence that Mrs. Frisby possesses is common sense with a deep love and devotion to her former husband and children - and is not looked down upon or scoffed at by the rats who have a ""superior"" intellegence. very interesting social commentary going on, but not above the level of reader that this book is intended for. her journey is a wonderful read and includes the real fruits of a journey such as sadness, frustration, success, joy, and indecision. 
 the characters are not sensationalized (which was a very good thing), but still match what i felt an owl's personality might be like, or a crow's personality might be like. i was most impressed by the ending of the novel, and the somewhat inconclusive nature of it that left it open...but it felt like the right thing to do from the literary standpoint and from characters standpoint as well. and i'll admit it, i was in LOVE with Justin, one of the rats with a super smooth coat, intellegence, kind heart, and an obvious crush on mrs. frisby! 
 fave quotes: while i was riveted by everything nicodemus said (one of the rats of nimh), there are two specific quotes that popped out at me while i was reading... 
 - (after Jeremy the crow is discovered by mrs. frisby) ""Birdbrain, thought Mrs. Frisby, and then recalled what her husband used to say: The size of the brain is no measure of it's capacity. And well she might recall it, for the crow's head was double the size of her own"" 
 - (when the rats are planning their escape) ""'And then what? What will happen when he announces that there's a group of civilized rats roaming loose - rats that can read, and think, and figure things out?' I said: 'Let's wait until we're free before we worry about that.' But Jenner was right. It was a thing to worry about, and maybe still is.""

"430",430,"Saige Paints The Sky continues the story of Saige Copeland, a real-life fourth grader who fights to bring art classes back to her elementary school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My 7-year-old sister and I absolutely loved the first book. We totally enjoyed it. It was a given that this one should be equally as impressive, as well. Sadly, that was not the case. This book bored us both to tears. Thanks to this book, story time became a huge fight and when I could get her to sit down and to listen to it, she just made faces at me or called me names... and that's when I managed to get her to pay me and Saige any attention. Being bullied by a 7-year-old for my poor choice in reading material is no fun. 
 I started thinking, because my little sister loved Saige so much, what went wrong with this book? I didn't have any fun reading this one either and I ended up reading the last half by myself, simply because I can't stand leaving a book unread. It was sooo dull, I couldn't wait for it to end. We are now reading an old American Girl favorite, 'Meet Addy' with much better results. So anyways back to Saige, what was wrong with the much anticipated (in our house anyways) second book? The only thing I can think of is that nothing exciting really ever happens. Saige has a very mild personality. She's obviously a wonderful kid, but nothing exciting enough to write a book about happened to her after the first book. In the first book she was preparing for a show during a parade and trying to get people excited about art classes and her grandma broke her arm and there was some friend drama. This one was just so lukewarm. The only reason I could see American Girl continuing the story is so we can see her complete the big goal of bringing art back to her school. That doesn't even happen in this book. I'm really not sure what the point is? 
 Don't get me wrong Saige is brilliant and very talented, she's a great role model for any girl and that alone I guess sort of makes it worth reading if you're like 9 or 10, but thinking back to when I was that age, I don't think I'd still have enjoyed this one. I think maybe it's just that Saige is such a goody-two-shoes, which I feel horrible complaining about. But there's a lack of spunk that most of the fictional American Girls have.

 Me da mucha rabia decir esto, pero es la verdad: no me ha gustado tanto como los dos anteriores. Ni de lejos. 
 Es una historia de viajes en el tiempo y ambientada en la India, mas enfocada en la aventura que no quiza en el misterio, la intriga o el poder de la hipnosis. Si la trama del segundo libro ya era un poco mas madura, esta lo es todavia mas, teniendo en cuenta que esta saga esta dirigida a lectores jovenes. 
 Sin embargo, no me ha tocado tan a fondo como los otros dos libros. Esto se debe a que el argumento se me ha hecho muy repetitivo y confuso (cambios de epoca, replicas de Molly y Petula, persecuciones a traves de los siglos...) . Si, viajar en el tiempo y estar en peligro constante de muerte es muy apremiante, pero...no. No me ha llegado. Me ha dado la sensacion de que ocurria lo mismo una y otra vez, que la historia no llegaba a ninguna parte y que se alejaba de cosas mas importantes como por ejemplo el estado de Lucy Logan, y como Primo Cell se ha enterado de que Molly es su hija. ?Cuando ha pasado? ?Lo han hablado ellos dos en privado y ya esta? No lo entiendo. Despues de ocultarselo de ese modo, me parece poco creible que se lo hayan dicho asi sin mas. Ah, y otra cuestion es la del villano, el malo malisimo. Me ha parecido muy rebuscado que haya sido el el que haya hipnotizado a Cornelius. Es decir, en el segundo libro nos creimos que el malo era Primo Cell, pero resulta que en realidad era Cornelius. Y ahora resulta que tampoco es Cornelius, sino que es Waqt. Es decir, utilizar esta estrategia una vez, otra tambien...pero una tercera, ya no.

"322",322,"Review taken from my blog, SugarQuills. 
 This is not a review of the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland story but rather a review Scarlett Johansson's narration of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. 
 Everyone knows the story of Alice, the little girl who fell down a rabbit hole and found herself having the most outlandish high of all time. 
 I wondered what an audiobook of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland would be like because you know, crazy land and all. After watching Her, I fell in love with Scarlett Johansson's voice. So naturally, I thought I'd enjoy an audiobook narrated by her and luckily, she narrated Alice's Adventures in Wonderland! 
 The first chapter was great, Johansson's voice was initially very soothing (yup that's the word), and I thought I was going to enjoy listening to the rest of the audiobook. I got through the first 15 minutes like ""Urgh yes this.is.perfect!"" 
 However, as the story progressed, I found myself getting agitated by Johansson's voice. When she spoke as Alice, it sounded like she was complaining all the time or on the verge of breaking into tears, for the other characters, her voice got pretty screechy, and I winced in pain when she spoke as the Queen of Hearts. (I'm not exaggerating). She was terrible at all of the other voices; I just about found the Mad Hatter bearable. It sounded like she was straining her voice to produce sounds, so I started wondering whether she was in pain instead of listening to the story. 
 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland quickly became an audiobook I just wanted to hurry up and finish listening to so I could stop listening to it. The audiobook has hundreds of glowing reviews on Audible, and I just don't understand why! My ears hurt after listening to this. 
 I didn't feel like Johansson did justice to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, it's a story featuring talking animals, a homicidal queen, and a kid most likely on acid and I actually had difficulty getting into it let alone liking it. My focus remained on the story up until chapter nine and after that, it was all background noise with me occasionally reacting to sudden sharp sounds from Johansson. 
 I wouldn't recommend this narration to anyone, especially not an Alice in Wonderland fan out of fear of having something hard thrown at my face.

 To be honest, the whole book was written like a to-do list. The farmer's family made different things. He sold those things at the market. He bought new things at the market. He walked home. His family ate. His family made new things. If my last few sentences were boring, don't read this book, because the whole book is written like that. 
 On the plus sides, the illustrations were good. I don't think they were amazing enough to win an award, though they did win the Caldecott. The illustrations look like scans on painting. It's very clean and realistic. The illustrator was also detailed. My favorite page had the town on it and the artist added in a boat hidden behind a building, and lots of corner markets.

 The relationship of one boy with his grandmother showed strongly that fear and misunderstanding can cause people to behave in ways they may not be happy about at a later time.

"303",303,"The Baudelaire orphans were once again sent to live with another distant relative, Uncle Monty. Uncle Monty is a herpetologist. He studies snakes, keeps them, and takes care of them inside the Reptile Room, hence the title. Unlike Count Olaf, Uncle Monty is a good person. He is nice, he takes care of the orphans, he treats them as his own children, he gives them separate, comfortable rooms, and he lets them do what they are passionate about (Violet inventing, Klaus reading and researching, and Sunny biting things). It looked like everything's finally going well with the children's lives, until we see Count Olaf arriving at their doorstep. He's disguised himself as Stephano, Uncle Monty's new assistant. I can't explain how utterly displeased I am about Olaf's reappearance. I can't deny that I hoped for a little bit that Olaf would be no more and that there would be a different antagonist instead (since we all know that the mishaps would never cease, at least get rid of Olaf). 
 As if Olaf's arrival wasn't enough, there goes the infuriating Snicket again. Like what I said in my review for the previous book, he keeps on emphasizing the Baudelaire children's tragic, unfortunate lives. There goes a fresh, happy scene, then he ruins it by freaking spoiling us about Uncle Monty's death? Seriously, Snicket? You that desperate to make your book seem so tragic and disturbing? Nuh-uh not a clever one. Ain't cool. We clearly, absolutely, get what you're trying to say. Can you just stop?

"710",710,"*I received a copy of this novel through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.* 
 I really enjoyed this story. It reminded me of all of the horse reading I did when I was younger. Being an equestrian myself, I always enjoy a well written horse related read. This one fit both of those requirements nicely. 
 The story is rather predictable for anyone who's read a lot of these types of novels, so it may not appeal to all readers. Personally I don't find that to be a negative aspect. If the story is well written and enjoyable, I will like it predictable or not. This is kind of a coming of age story. Kate has to accept things in her past that she wishes she could forget, all while dealing with her new job and snobby girls who want everything handed to them. 
 The characters here were likable. Kate and Holly are the main characters we get to see and they become friends immediately. Angela, the brat whose mother tries to run the stable, is both easy to dislike and easy to feel bad for. When you see her with her mother it's easy to understand why she might be the way she is. At fourteen I would hope she might be able to outgrow some of that, but it's not the easiest age to overcome such things. 
 The main thing that I found too extreme here, was the fact that everyone from Kate's old barn automatically blamed her for Magic's death. While it was a terrible occurrence, accidents do happen and treating a child so cruelly was taking things too far for me. 
 The horse event was nicely described. A little over the top at points, but that just makes it more exciting for young readers. It was nice to see some development with the characters and where they were headed next. Overall it was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to those who enjoy easy to read horse related stories.",4,0.121,0.316,0.957,1.672

"429",429,"Claudia decides she is done with this baby-sitting shit when a child breaks her leg. Don't quit, Claudia--Kristy will break your other one! 
 I remembered this from childhood as the ""this is what happens when you break your leg"" book, entranced, then, with process details about the ambulance, hospital stay, recuperation, and cast removal. In my reread, I was surprised to find that the emphasis was actually on Claudia's inner turmoil as she considers dropping out of the club because sitting is too dangerous. 
 Meanwhile, the baby-sitters wage a ""practical joke war"" on the unrepentant prankster Betsy Sobak in an attempt to teach her not to practical joke. I gotta tell you, if breaking someone's leg didn't do it, escalation is surely not the answer. Except it sort of is, in this book. I don't know. I hate practical jokes. 
 My main problem with this book is that it seems like there's no particular reason for it to be a Claudia story. They do manage a character-based justification for her fears (what if she'd hurt her arm or her hand? her art would suffer!), but the obsessive fear itself seems a little out of character for Claudia. I mean, I'd expect it more from Dawn, who has a yellow streak a mile wide; Mary Anne, who overthinks everything; or even Kristy, because it would be delightfully ironic from the usually intrepid tomboy. Claudia is the only one, in fact, who has no particular established relationship with fear. 
 Lingering Questions: So nothing happens in the two months between Claudia's accident and when she gets her cast off? It would be cool if, to give a sense of the scale of the time frame, the next two books had Claudia in a cast. 
 Real Timeline: This is where I figure out how old the baby-sitters would be if each story year advanced the timeline. This one actually covers 3 months (Claudia recuperates in the hospital at home for a total of one month, then gets her cast off two months later.) Happily, there is room for a time skip here since the previous book takes place in November and the next takes place in April (still in eighth grade). It's not super easy to reconcile this with an unmentioned holiday season and cold weather (and the accident does happen while playing outside), but whatever. I'm surprised it works at all.

 The Princess Imogene is trying to prepare for her 13th birthday by reading The Art of Being a Princess, but is finding it a struggle. She's not particularly beautiful or kind or any of the things that princesses are supposed to be. This might be why, when she is approached by a frog, she agrees to kiss him to break the spell. The only problem? She has kissed Harry, a local boy who has irritated a witch, and now SHE will be a frog unless she can convince someone else to kiss her and then be turned into a frog. She asks the witch to break the spell, but she refuses. Next, she ends up in the clutches of the well-meaning but dense Luella and her beau, Bertie, who convinces Louella to run away with his troupe of actors, where they can find fame and fortune by showcasing the ""talking Chinese frog"". This plan doesn't go the way either Imogene or Luella would like-- Imogene just wants to get home to her parents, and Luella is not allowed to act. Eventually, the two make it back to the castle, where a family friend of Imogene helps her figure out a way to break the curse. 
 Strengths: Having just done a unit on myths, folk tales and fairy tales with a seventh grade language arts class, this would be a fun book for students to read. Imogene's plight as a frog is amusing and makes for a light read, and the cover is fresh and appealing. 
 Weaknesses: Something seemed to be missing. Imogene had to linger far too long with the actors, and I kept waiting for something... bigger to happen. The ending was similarly dissatisfying.

"425",425,"Sophie's world plays well as an introduction to philosophy, especially to younger people as the author (Jostein Gaarder) has brilliantly intertwined abstract philosophical concepts unfolding within a whimsical tale of a teenaged girl named Sophie, who receives random letters from an anonymous person, which would set her to a chain of discoveries about herself and the reality of her existence. As a critic said, Sophie's world is an compendium of the history of Western philosophy presented as an entertaining novel of a young lady's magical journey which faintly reminds the reader of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. 
 I rated it 2/5 stars (it was ok). Although it was an entertaining read, I felt that there were some points that the author have overlooked that made the story and the characters a tad too unrealistic and dragging at times. 
 First off, Sophie character was a bit unrealistic. I do not refer to the story as unrealistic as I understand that it was meant to be a fantasy fiction and Gaarder pulled it off well in this book plus considering the fact that he embedded philosophical concepts throughout the story. However I found Sophie's character as unrealistic because she seems to be hardly anything but a 14 year old girl. I'm not sure if Norwegian teenage girls mature that early, but I saw Sophie as too mature for her age by the way she thinks and behave throughout the story. 
 I also found the story a bit too dragging as it had to progress way too long and slowly 3/4 of the whole time before gaining momentum and to fully shake out our assumptions towards the end of the story. In between that slow progress there was no event that could have thrown the reader off the hook just to break that drag. 
 Overall, Sophie's World is an excellent introduction to philosophy not only for teenagers and young adults but for older audiences as well who want to get a general overview of Western philosophy in a fun, fresh, and entertaining way. I know that philosophical concepts may be quite difficult to grasp initially and so it does help to incorporate a background story to philosophical concepts as well, to which Gaarder has done very well. I also commend Gaarder for presenting the history of Western philosophy into a single book, which he had done by way of cherry-picking important concepts which were representative of each philosophical era and even providing historical details that could initiate further research on the reader's part. 
 But as a student of philosophy I found the book not as 'jam-packed' and elaborate as standard philosophical textbooks but then it would be like comparing apples to oranges. I also can't help but compare it to other books that have philosophical themes such as Camus' The Stranger but then we'd have to remember that this book is aimed at younger audiences, which Camus' book will not qualify for as it is meant for a more mature audience. Older audiences can read both Sophie's World and The Stranger but I doubt if it is still effective vice versa (with exceptions of course). And one more factor is that Sophie's World focuses on the history of Western philosophy while The Stranger focuses on Camus' existentialist philosophy. 
 So my conclusion: Sophie's World is a great intro to philosophy especially for beginners who want to be entertained and informed at the same time, but if you want to have a more elaborate introduction to philosophy a standard textbook will do it better which can still be fun as well as the more recent textbooks present the subject in a more systematic, objective, and updated way.",2,0.288,0.179,0.998,1.638

"210",210,"This book is horrible. 
 (Full disclosure: once upon a time, I thought Dave Barry was funny -- in the 80's -- so not a total hater.) 
 But I'm a huge J.M. Barrie fan (or Johnny Depp-as-J.M. Barrie). 
 p.s. I read it -- b/c I heard on comingsoon: they're going to make it into a movie. 
 Read the real Peter Pan alongside it -- I was doing that -- and you'll feel totally insulted. 
 The original...We've all seen the Disney cartoon (and the legend is so big), so we think we know it. But no. 
 It's so well-written. Every single line is funny, practically. 
 And he sticks in some side-commentary, for example...Fantastic. 
 (The 2003 live action Pan is pretty great -- also b/c it's close to the book. So, I mean: better than Disney.) 
 Anyhow: the book is horrible. And a terrible affront to the memory and real thing. 
 Peter & the Starcatchers not funny at all. I would say: ""Like they're not even trying...but they are a tiny bit, and it doesn't work."" 
 The plot is really small and frail. Could sum it up in one paragraph: a treasure chest full of fairy dust. The bad guys try to steal it. (The good guys try to stop them. It's a race.) Peter gets some, and it makes him fly. 
 And it's so formulaic -- like, they have a list. ""Okay. What do we need in there, to make it look like a Peter Pan book ? 
 A boy named Peter: check. 
 Someone who ends up being Hook: check. 
 ""Let's call him Black Stache. That's a stupid name."" Check. 
 Smittee, some fairy dust, alligator, mermaids, flying... 
 Anyhow, I'm really angry. It's one of the saddest things I've ever read. A rip-off and a cheap knock-off, forgery / travesty... Really just an insult to one of the greatest stories ever. 
 And so now Disney is turning it into a movie. 
 Here's the thing, too: I, personally, would love to see the further adventures of Peter Pan -- if someone could write them well, make them interesting. 
 Be true to the original (even the side-commentary, I think)...Of course, have some of the old elements -- but have some new stuff, too, that's cool and interesting. Fun. 
 The new stuff here: talking porpoises. Horrible. 
 Really -- like ""Worst.Book.Ever."" 
 (I wanted to put zero stars. But I had to put one, so they knew I registered.) 
 p.s. Final thought: I think I'm going to write my own further adventures of Peter Pan, someday.

"330",330,"The History of Hilary Hambrushina is JUST your typical high school drama. 
 While there was nothing BAD about this book, there wasn't anything GOOD about it either. Following your unoriginal story about high school, this book manages to incorporate a lot of themes. You've got 'the best friend' who ends up being a traitor, the 'new girl' who ends up being awesome, the 'mean girls' who are bullies - full stop. And then you've got Hilary who is a mess 'and figuring' herself out. 
 This book ISN'T something fabulous, something you enjoy and love to bits, it's a book that teaches you about friendship, accepting yourself, overcoming obstacles, and standing up for who you really are. That's definitely an enjoyable element to the book, that the characters do funny things but all together are just a REALLY and SUPER boring cast. Kallie is the only one with a little 'sustenance' to her and I ended up liking her quite a bit. Hilary is a little 'fat' (though I think that was subjective) and I feel like her accepting herself is also quite an interesting part of the story. 
 The writing style is very basic and MG-ish. Sure I smiled at some points, but the writing definitely fitted the story line. A simple story line and simple writing. It was an easy read, nothing too dense and complicated, and I finished it relatively quickly. The pace was okay, and if you're looking for a breezy book on a summer's day, this book could be perfect for that. The only problem with the writing style is that it doesn't allow you to get engaged with the story, it feels like you are an outsider, and everything seems a bit dull. 
 The plot is basically just 'happiness over popularity, 'it's okay to be who you are' and all that other self-acceptance stuff. I feel it's important to represent different people but here I feel like any reader is too mature to read this. It deals with many issues but I just don't feel I related to any of it. Maybe younger readers would be interested in the drama about this new teenage life but I certainly wasn't. 
 All in all, Marnie Lamb tried to create something about self-love and overcoming the problems of school and such, and I think that was wonderful. The way this was executed, with a boring writing style, a typical story line and half-fleshed out characters just DIDN'T allow the reader to be captured. Don't get me wrong, the themes were great, but it was too typical and boring. These types of books are getting repetitive now and I feel it needs to be shaken up a little.",1,0.194,0.244,0.998,1.608

"834",834,"A child heads into bear country with a helpful narrator who tries to offer needed advice in dealing with bears. First, the narrator tells the child of the two kinds of bears, but assures them that they will never see one. But then on the next page, the child is lucky enough to encounter a bear right away. And it's apparently a black bear, not only due to its coloring but because it chases the child right up a tree. The child backs away slowly and runs right into a brown bear next. The child plays dead, but that only invites the black bear to come closer. Pepper spray doesn't help, it just makes them hungry. But perhaps gum will be the solution! Or maybe not. 
 It is the interplay between the knowledgeable adult narrator and the child who manages to get into all sorts of furry trouble that makes this book such a great pick to share aloud. The bears are huge and fearsome but the book also makes sure to show that there are ways to interact with nature that leaves everyone alright in the end, if a little shaken. The book also mentions that it is not safe to really interact with bears like the child does in the book. 
 The illustrations are wonderful. They move from cartoon friendliness to pages of information that have a graph paper background. The use of a gender-free main character who has brown skin, makes this book all the more friendly to children from a variety of backgrounds. And the merry way that the child faces each obstacle adds to the light-hearted feel of the book.

"969",969,"Summary (SPOILER): 
 Ralph's teacher says that everyone has a story to tell, stories are everywhere! She seems to be right. During writing time at school, everyone around Ralph is writing their stories. The problem is, Ralph doesn't have a story to tell. He stares around the room, searches the hallways, and attempts to help the lunch ladies all to find a story. He wants to write, but he doesn't have anything to tell. He even asks the girl next to him, who tells him that she has written several stories about him. How could she write a story about Ralph when he has no stories to tell? When the teacher comes by, he has to think about something quickly, so he tells her a quick response. Then when it is time to share, Ralph stumbles with what he thinks is not a story. It isn't until after he tells a little that the questions from his classmates fly in. Ralph realizes he really does have a story to tell. 
 My thoughts: 
 This is adorable! It's definitely a child's version of writer's block. I taught first grade (many years ago) and had several students that just couldn't think of a story to tell; however, if you asked them a quick question, then they would have so much to say. Ralph just doesn't see all of the adventures that he has. I think this is a great book to teach that lesson. A Kinder or First grade teacher NEEDS to have this book.

He's still pretty true to form Slappy but with a few differences that might just have come from time or from the natural changes that a character goes through as an author writes of him or her.

Would this work for a real Morris, flamboyantly dressed, challenging definitions of gender parameters? Well, it's worth a try, isn't it? Morris, with the loving support of his mom, flips things on their head and, in doing so, is able to retain his sense of self while opening others'.

"374",374,"I like that this book is beautifully illustrated- though it's a style that isn't my favorite. I love that it emphasizes the importance of unplugged time in nature- literally stopping to smell the roses or observe a sunset. 
 Here is what I don't like...Henry and his friend are going the same place and decide to race to see who can get there faster. henry will walk and his friend will take the train after working to earn the money for the train ticket. So, for the majority of the book the left hand page shows Henry's friend toiling and the right hand page shows Henry walking and observing nature and relaxing. 
 The two bears end up arriving at the same time, but Henry's friends trip was more stressful because the train was crowded and Henry had time to stop to pick berries to share with his friend. 
 OK- so here is my take on this preaching taking the time to stop and smell the roses is not a message most children need. This is a message that is appropriate for adults and the fact that they show the earnings of the friend for each job he did just so he could buy a train ticket seems to devalue the hard work that he did. This is an important message for workaholics, but reading it to my kid seemed to devalue work. The friend wasn't proud and happy of his accomplishments at the end. His feelings aren't indicated but I suspect that he was annoyed that Henry had a great day and he had to work and have a rather miserable train ride. 
 So, if you like to emphasize the value of a hard day's work steer clear of this book- find something where the reward at the end of the day is celebrated and if you want a book that shows how to value nature's beauty or slowing down and spending quality time doing things that you could do faster with automation there are better books out there for that, too. 
 This is also not a book about quality family time, but quality alone time so an introverted child might identify with it more than my kids who would want to have friends with them to share their discovers in nature with. 
 I recommend Grandpa's Fantastic Scarf for a much better book about valuing life and its ups and downs and time with family and nature. This book just misses the mark for the messages I want my kids to hear.",2,0.212,0.512,0.997,1.57

I was more accustomed to Aiken's airy disregard of plausibility and practicality(eg. minor details like, when a hired sleigh pulls up at door pursued by wolves and all the passengers rush inside, what happens to the sleigh and horses? Never mentioned again?)and the stage was definitely enlivened by the first appearance of Dido Twite, who becomes the long-running overall protagonist of the series. Apart from her invincibly buoyant character, the licence her faux Cockney-quasi-Heyer-Regency-slang language gives Aiken is a constant refreshment from this book forward. Not sure how much of it she researched, how much she stole from Heyer - quite a lot, from what I cd. see - and how much she just made up, but the slang/argot certainly livened up things overall. 
 Simon the goose boy also improved on acquaintance and the wide canvas of London, slum or otherwise, was engaging enough to discount the further load of highly inedible coincidences (*ANOTHER* flipping lost heir? ANOTHER set of lost brother and sister?) and the ever more implausible consequences of Hanoverian plots.

The Duke of Battersea's balloon can be held still against a roof while half the family embark and disembark, with no sign of moorings that I cd. see?

 This is an enlightening look into the difficult lives of refugees. The difficulty of learning a new language while trying to adapt to the culture and even climate of the USA, all the while worrying about family back home, makes this transition difficult at best.

 * Showing multicultural mix of people 
 * Showing babywearing 
 * Promoting environmental awareness 
 But as a children's picture book it falls flat on its face. 
 The rhyme which is heavily promoted on the back cover is an ABCB rhyme pattern. The author has worked extremely hard to get these rhyming words. Unfortunately to get these rhyming words the author has been forced to use a widely varying number of syllables per line. This destroys the overall rhythm of the book when read aloud. 
 The double page spread on cleaning up the environment seems to be a significant departure from the main message of the book. 
 I thought I was reading a book aimed at preschoolers who's mum was about to start breastfeeding a new baby... But as I read the book I increasingly thought the target audience was instead semi-literate mums-to-be... 
 The illustrations showed lots of mums happily breastfeeding, but beyond that they did little to add to the book. 
 I think breastfeeding is fantastic. I feel the best way to promote breastfeeding is simply by showing it as a normal part of life - both in real life and through the stories we tell and read.

First Book of Sushi also differs in that the foods chosen for presentation are even less mainstream to the U.S. Japanese restaurant scene than in Yum Yum Dim Sum. I have to admit, I'd never heard of the majority of the foods mentioned in this book. 
 Similar to Yum Yum Dim Sum, I believe First Book of Sushi may find its main audience with Japanese immigrants who wish to give their babies a small piece of Japanese culture to grow up with even as they are immersed in the culture of the land where they live.

 I guess the appeal of these Disney books is the familiar characters. There's some mention of shadows in this book, and even less about shapes. It comes off as an unfocused mish-mash. The characters don't solve their own dilemmas; whenever they come upon an obstacle, Mickey calls some deus-ex-machina-like magical mouse-ears thing that brings whatever they need. It's gimmicky and circumvents the development of any problem-solving skills.

 Science fiction is pretty awesome partly because you're not you and reality isn't reality. You get to accept new givens and move on from there to enjoy the what-ifs. So what troubled me most about this story--even in all its multiple possibilities--was that all the paths led to poorly conceived scenarios. They were just rough sketches of the what-ifs without answering the questions. And when you do find Atlantis--let's face it, we all go into this book knowing some of the endings will lead to Atlantis--it's some kind of caricature of ancient people, as if no time has passed for them since Atlantis myths began to be told. Decent science fiction stories don't cop out like that just so their creatures can be recognized. I think these books would actually be a lot better if there were only a couple scenarios and they played out more richly rather than drumming up excitement over letting you get to pick and then having most of what you can pick lead to meaningless mockeries of stories.",2,0.215,0.333,0.97,1.51

Cousins doesn't exactly gloss over the part of the story where the world is destroyed, but the general tone of this book is happy and calming. Noah has a smile on his face on almost every page, unless he's concentrating, as in the pictures where he's sawing wood for the ark. Her gouache paintings are done in the same bright, childlike style as the Maisy books. If it weren't for the religion part of the story, I'd happily use it in a storytime about animals.

"419",419,"Meet My Best Friend is a picturebook written by Shelia Walsh and illustrated Sarah Horne. The McDougal twins are excited to meet their new neighbor, Abby, who has just moved in next door. Poor Abby is sad that she had to leave her friends behind when she moved. To cheer her up, the twins lead Abby on a crazy hunt to meet their best friend, one that can go anywhere they go. But first Abby has to find it! 
 Meet My Best Friend starts off fairly well, with Abby trying to find her place in a new home and dealing with leaving behind her friends and everything familiar. The McDougal twins want to help her, and want to be friends. So far so good, with decent illustrations that are reminiscent of Dr. Suess and text. I like the idea so far, and it seems like it is going to be a sweet book. Then the twins take Abby on a wild game of hide and seek in search of their best friend. I like that they want to play with Abby and become her friend. That is good. Then the twins announce that their best friend is the bible. Silly me, I was expecting a pet or maybe even a tree or other more earthly answer. The bible is a book, an object. while I have loved and appreciated books, and escaped into them when the world is less than hospitable, it is not a friend. I would have had less of an issue if they had claimed God, Jesus, or any other religious figure rather than the bible. It just rubbed me the wrong way on several levels. 
 I was not paying attention when requesting the book, because I normally do not read religious fiction. Totally my fault for not looking, but I tend to get easily annoyed at books that push an agenda, any agenda, even one I might personally agree with. I am a practicing christian, but often find religious fiction to be too heavy handed to be realistic or enjoyable to read. This happened as soon as the twins announce that the bible is their best friend. I think this might be a good read in a Sunday School setting, or in a very religious household.

 In an attempt to teach children core values in a fun and imaginative way, Dr. Spencer Johnson introduces an ""Imaginography,"" defined by the author as a ""story about a real person that helps children imagine the kind of person they want to become."" The book uses stories of four genuine heroes to exemplify everyday values Louis Pasteur (believing in yourself), Harriet Tubman (helping), Confucius (honesty), Helen Keller (determination), and Will Rogers (humor). The brightly colored illustrations rendered in oil paint paired alongside the narrative biographies provide a creative and informative lesson for youngsters. The historical facts at the end of each section are thorough and offer useful links for additional information. However, the messages are confusing, especially when each characters imaginary ""True Voice"" (Bee Lieve the Bee for Pasteur and Starry the North Star for Tubman) are shown whispering encouraging, yet nagging advice into the main character's ear. The idea of using a nonexistent ""True Voice"" does not seem ethically just especially with ""Larry the Rope"" who shows Will Rogers how to have some fun but behave himself too, and the three mice, Sight, Sound, and Speech who guide Helen Keller are seemingly satirical and mocking. The faces on inanimate objects are cute but breach obnoxious with awkward illustrations such as a moon with a bat for a mouth and multicolored smiling blobs to represent rabies. The text is earnest but gets preachy and condescending, and the rhetorical questions in every section never manage to truly evoke the point and range from usefully challenging (""Do you know what was wrong with the dog?"") to obvious (""Do you enjoy it when you can make someone laugh?"") and repetitive (""Do you feel good when you are able to laugh at yourself"")?

 Hace un tiempo una amiga y yo pensabamos en tener un podcast sobre libros y una de las entradas estaba relacionada con los mitos de los cuentos. En resumen, que me lei este libro (entre otros cuentos infantiles) pero no hemos grabado el programa. 
 Cuando era mucho mas joven habia leido en mas de una ocasion libros con los cuentos de estos dos hermanos, pero ya hacia mucho tiempo y ya no recordaba mas que unos cuantos y me ha gustado retomar la esta lectura clasica. 
 El libro es un compendio de cuentos que en su mayoria son bastante cortos, algunos solo tienen un par de paginas, mientras que los mas largos serian equiparables a un capitulo de una novela. 
 Dentro hay un monton de cuentos, cuales? Caperucita, La bella durmiente, Cenicienta, Blanca Nieves, Hansel y Gretel, ... muchisimos! Pero no todos estos cuentos son de ellos, de hecho, puedes ver como los cuentos clasicos coinciden en algunos de los autores clasicos (como por ejemplo Perrault), porque los hermanos Grimm no son unos escritores como podriamos entender, sino que son mas bien unos escribanos, unos recopiladores. 
 El autentico merito de esta obra es que los Hermanos Grimm han logrado transcribir los cuentos y leyendas existentes en su pais durante la epoca en la que ellos vivieron, plasmarlas para lograr la conservacion y mayor difusion de esas historias y perpetuarlas a lo largo de mas de 2siglos. 
 Una de las maneras de acercarse a esta compilacion es disfrutar de todos estos cuentos pensando de que epoca vienen y que muchos de ellos se usan como parabolas, como ensenanzas, mas alla de los cuentos de princesas y madrastras malvadas. Muchos de los cuentos inciden en la condicion de la naturaleza humana, si, de manera un tanto burda y con unas analogias no muy elaboradas, pero mostrandonos que muchos de los miedos que estaban en la sociedad hace 200 anos siguen estando presentes entre nosotros y que los comportamientos de las personas se repiten, que la maldad, la envidia, los celos o cualquier otro sentimiento no es algo que se haya inventado hoy. Aunque claro, tambien lo puedes leer como un recopilatorio donde aparecen muchas princesas un poco tontas y las madrastras malvadas.",3,-0.114,-0.6,-0.844,1.46

"443",443,"Handsome Princes and Castles in the Sky 
 16 November 2013 
 These days when we think of Snow White we probably think of her: 
 Though this is how many of us probably remember her: 
 As for me, I would probably have to relate to the second one, though whenever I see it I generally roll my eyes and groan (though when I was at Disneyland a couple of years ago I did notice that there were a number of princesses, and I even tried to guess who they were). 
 This book is an adaptation of the Disney Movie of the same name, which in turn is an adaptation of one of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales. Personally I would like to actually read the original fairy tale than the Disney book about princes and castles in the sky (seriously, a prince comes along and takes Snow White away to his castle in the sky - which may have had a different meaning back then, but for some reason I doubt it). 
 As for this book I felt that they were trying to squeeze too much into too short a book and as such I found that the book seems to jump somewhat at the end. Basically she is suddenly approached by the wicked queen (who just happens to fall into a chasm and die), falls asleep, and then, out of the blue, her darling prince comes along and rescues here. 
 However, this could be an analogy for a much for sinister and sad ending (and we can't have sad endings in a modern children's story, can we). Maybe what really happened is that Snow White never woke up, and the prince is actually her angel taking her up to heaven, which is her castle in the clouds.

 Gr. 2-4 
 Alice-Miranda Highton-Smith-Kennington-Jones is going away to the Winchesterfield-Downsfordvale Academy for Proper Young Ladies. At age seven-and-one-quarter, she's the youngest student in school. Alice-Miranda arrives and begins solving problems immediately, from the students' to the grounds keeper's to the cook's. When the headmistress, Miss Grimm, takes a disliking to the adorable little girl, Alice-Miranda must find a way to solve that problem too. 
 Alice-Miranda emulates the late great Richie Rich of Harvey Comics fame in everything but the robot butler. The ultimate extreme in cute, rich, kind, and genius, Alice-Miranda is a good role model with her ability to always see the best in everyone. A fun mystery, with fantastical, over-the-top elements. Because the reading level may be slightly more difficult than the interest level, this would make an excellent classroom read-a-loud. Recommended to fans of James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl.

"902",902,"This is an astonishingly good book. I wish I'd read it when I was young - I know I would have loved it then - but at least I discovered it in the end. The story is action-packed, following two young cousins left with no adult help against - surely - some of the most dispicable villains of children's literature ever created. Bonnie is a wonderfully feisty heroine, tempered by Sylvia, who must dig deep to find the strength and courage she needs to survive her ordeals. 
 When I started reading, I was drawn in at once by the rich historical settings, the gentle humour and the promise of a classic cousin partnership. Sylvia's train journey towards the start of the book is exciting, funny and altogether extraordinary, and from then on the story never wanes. There are so many appealing plot aspects - such as the clever use of hidey-holes and secret passages, and the delicious idea of running away from tyrannical adults - and the jeopardy is so terrible in places, I was behind the two young heroines all the way.",5,0.28,0.448,0.994,1.428

 --Imelda, The Facts and Fictions of Minna Pratt, P. 86 
 If Patricia MacLachlan's name weren't printed on the cover of this book, I can't say that I'd have been likely to be able to identify her as the author just from the writing. I'm used to a slightly more rhythmic sensation to the words she chooses, the gentle waves of her lovely descriptions creating a quiet harmony even when they're describing just mundane, everyday things, or simple outdoors scenes that we could pass a hundred times without ever looking at with deeper insight. The Facts and Fictions of Minna Pratt has more of an urban feel to it, but Patricia MacLachlan's writing is no less nice for the different type of surroundings. As always, she manages to tell a story with utmost economy of words, putting a fair amount of plot into a relatively short junior novel. 
 Minna Pratt comes from an eccentric family, a situation certainly not unfamiliar to the main characters in Patricia MacLachlan's stories. Her parents and younger brother, McGrew, all have artsy temperaments, and while Minna has her own fair share of endowment in that area, she approaches life from a much more serious and analytical point of view. Though Minna has been taking cello lessons for years, she's never really hit her groove with it, being surpassed by some of the other students as their ""light"" turns on and they really get what they're trying to do with their individual instruments. As she waits for her own moment of inspiration to arrive, a new student joins the class, a boy named Lucas who has played the viola for as long as Minna has been involved with the cello. The debut pupil quickly befriends Minna and provides her with a new take on her quirky family, as well as on her own much less spontaneous personality. Lucas actually wishes that he might have a family a little bit more like Minna's, and as they learn from each other about better understanding the families they were born into, Lucas also serves as the bridge between Minna and her cello epiphany that she's been awaiting for so long. 
 I can't say that I'm totally sure what this book is meant to teach. The story is nice, though, and there are some memorable characters (especially McGrew, in my opinion) to add a smile or two along the way. I would give one and a half stars to The Facts and Fictions of Minna Pratt.",2,0.28,0.739,0.993,1.426

 Naomi and Owen have been left by their alcoholic mother, Skyla, with their great grandmother, who is trying very hard to raise them in a trailer park near an avocado orchard. Owen has many special needs, but is very bright. Their close knit community includes the grandmother's friend, Flora. When Skyla shows up with a boyfriend who has decided that they can provide a companion to his daughter and get money for raising the children, the three are afraid that she will carry through on this, especially since she does not feel capable of raising Owen and intends to split the children up. When this looks likely, the grandmother gets her friends to help take the trailer to Mexico to find the children's father and visit Flora's family.

So I agonised a lot over my impressions of Pinocchio: Is it only a matter of personal taste? Am I missing something? Should I rethink my rating based on learned opinions spanning more than a century? In the end, I decided to go with my original evaluation. 
 This is one of those stories you read and love in comics format or abridged versions before you come into contact with the original. What usually happens is that, those adaptations modify and trim the original tale to suit the sensibilities of the current generation. I also read Pinocchio as a comic book and loved it; however, on reading the original, I find that many of the ""creepier"" elements had been edited out of that version. 
 I do not love moral fables for children. The type of story where, for example, the disobedient little lamb is gobbled up by the big, bad wolf, crying with his last breath: ""Oh! If I had only listened to my mother!"" is terrifying to kids (I speak from personal experience). They are equivalent to the posters of hell which some people were fond of hanging in their drawing rooms during my childhood. In the nineteenth century, when Collodi wrote his story, one can easily understand that this must have been an accepted method of keeping children in line: by frightening them out of their wits. I do not think the modern world will look kindly on that method. 
 It is not that creepiness by itself is bad. Many fairy tales are frightening, with their suggestions of cannibalism, patricide, incest, torture etc. The difference between the fairy tale and the moral fable is that the fairy tale is a live entity, growing, shrinking and changing shape while travelling from mouth to mouth; the messages are subliminal, interacting with the child's subconscious. The moral fable on the other hand, is ""purposeful"" - there is a message (""if you do this, then this will happen!"") which the author wants to drum into the child's head, usually by using fear as a tool. It is the narrative equivalent of the schoolmaster's swishing cane. 
 Collodi's story, taken by itself, has many wonderful elements of dark fantasy (the huge Dogfish which swallows ships whole, the snake with a tail which smokes like a chimney, the little white man who converts boys to donkeys and sells them...) and could have made a wonderful fairy tale. However, the moralising on almost every page of what happens to bad boys who do not obey their parents, do not study and tell lies takes all the fun out of it: the voice of the narrator, coming out through various parental figures, becomes sickening. What crowned the whole thing for me was the death of poor Candlewick, Pinocchio's friend, after short life of back-breaking labour as a donkey. Yuck! . I was happy when the story ended. 
 I would recommend reading it to children with the morality edited out: but why bother? There are better books out there. Or let them read it as a comic book, or watch the Disney movie.",1,0.013,-0.08,-0.686,1.398

 ""Some people have scars on the inside, and other people's are on the outside. It shouldn't matter."" 
 --Logan Sweet, The Candymakers, P. 423 
 I really think that this might be my surprise book of the year for 2010. It's no revelation to me that Wendy Mass is capable of turning out very good literature, but there's so much more to The Candymakers than I ever would have guessed. It could be an ideal ""poster boy"" for why it's not a good idea to judge books by their cover. The book jacket and accompanying description of this novel are kind of on the zany side and might suggest a silly story suited exclusively for the younger grade-school set, but don't let the facade of this book fool you. The Candymakers is a story of depth and obviously intelligent and thoughtful writing, with so many surprises and smart twists to the plot that you never feel sure you've reached the bottom of the barrel until the final page. The characters, always a major strong suit for Wendy Mass, will really grow on you over time; there's no one spot in the narrative where you'll find yourself saying, ""Hey, I like these characters a lot!"", but by the end of the book you'll know without a doubt that you do actually care about them, and the proof of it will be in your reluctance to have the story come to a close. How often does one reach the end of a four hundred fifty-three page book and really wish for more? Wendy Mass has a special way of putting the people in her books into the hearts of her readers, so that they wish they could come be a part of the story too, and be linked with something as powerful and meaningful as what the characters have just experienced. I believe that Wendy Mass is right there in the discussion with the preeminent character creators writing today, a status of no small importance or easy means to achieve. 
 The Candymakers is so cleverly executed and fitted together so adroitly that I hesitate to describe very much of the plot; to do so would surely trip some of the surprises that wait within the book, and I don't want to take the chance of doing that. What I will say is that it's about four unique kids with their own rich and varied personal backstories, brought together by much more than just random chance for a contest at the Life Is Sweet (sorry, but I can't figure out how to type the eye-catching looped ""t"" the way it's done in the book!) candy factory in the town of Spring Haven. Thirty-two prospective candy entrepreneurs, every one of them twelve years old, will compete at candy factories from all around to come up with a new candy innovative enough to capture the contest's first prize: a $1,000 grant and the agreement that one of the factories that hosted the competition will begin to manufacture and distribute the winning candy for general sale. 
 Logan Sweet would appear to have an edge on his ""adversaries""; he is the son of The Candymaker himself, who happens to own the Life Is Sweet factory, and has been involved in even the most inscrutable disciplines of candy making since as far back as he knows. The four kids joining him for the competition to be held at his father's factory are Miles, Daisy and Philip, all of whom have their own different reasons for wanting to win, but with backstories that are much less immediately apparent than Logan's. Winning a contest against thirty-one opponents is tricky under any circumstances, but keeping track of one's priorities and trying to keep the prize in sight when everything seems to always be changing can be even trickier. The perceptions that Logan and the three others competing alongside him each have of their own life situation will change repeatedly, each one of them realizing that there are things they viewed correctly and others they may not have, all of which will call into question for them as individuals the legitimacy of their desire to capture the grand prize. Who will take home top honors in this contest, and how much will that really even matter in the end? 
 There's a good chance that I would give the full three stars to The Candymakers. It's a long book for its age demographic, but truly worth reading for students with open hearts and minds. The story is tender and philosophical, brimming with the kind of wisdom that any parent or teacher would love to have their child experience. It's not every day that a book like this comes along. This is a story that I honestly feel I'm a slightly better person for having read, an unforgettable novel that I really believe will prove touching and unforgettable to any age group. I have so much respect for Wendy Mass and her ability as a writer, and that respect only continues to increase with each book of hers that I read. I love The Candymakers, and I give it my warmest recommendation.

Who blends with you as well as peanut butter and jelly, smushed between two slices of bread to make the best sandwich known to mankind?

It kept the actual characters, the same background and the general feel of the show itself but against the title of the actual series - Wishbone - the lovable pooch wasn't an actual main character at all. 
 For those who haven't seen the show the show is based off a cute terrier book-reading pup who tells the story of whatever may be happening against the background of a particular book where he is playing the main character. It was a great show that introduced children to some of the harder to read and dry ""Classics"". 
 Unfortunately in this book Wishbone was a third wheel for the most part who just occasionally was able to get out on his own occasionally.

 I've gradually grown more disappointed by Dahl... not with his writing style mind you but with the tone of his writing. I wondered what I was getting into when reading these books. 
 This book is a compilation of seven short stories. I won't delve into the details of the plots of all but I will say that the tone of most of these stories are more for an adult than a child. With that in mind the slightly negative or serious tone to the stories I think is more appropriate. 
 Still, one of the stories disturbed me. Two bully boys constantly pestered (for lack of a better word) a much smaller and very passive boy. The story ended with the bullies cutting the wings off of a dead swan, (that they killed) and tying them on the bullied boy, making him climb a tree and then ending up shooting him in the thigh. Yes. That definitely disturbed me. 
 Otherwise I enjoyed the other stories in the book which included two nonfiction stories. Dahl's writing style remains captivating.",3,-0.292,-0.6,-0.976,1.368

"630",630,"This is the first book in the Tilda Pinkerton and the Magical Hats chapter book series. It's got a cute cover and a welcoming page for kids that informs them how to use the book. They can color the pages and look up the new vocabulary words in the glossary found at the end of the book. It contains 344 words. We received the book with some beautiful stickers and a postcard message from the author. 
 The story is about eleven year-old Madison Mae and her younger seven year-old brother Albert who live on the family farm with their grandparents. It's not quite clear why their parents left them there, except that the children permanently live with their grandparents. The parents are only mentioned twice in the whole story. The children want to save the farm and have the chance to do so when Tilda Pinkerton shows up out of the blue with her shop of magical hats--hats that cause the wearer to use their imagination and create beautiful things. 
 I read this book with my son and after the first few chapters I can see that he wasn't too engaged. He lost interest in the story soon after. I think it's because the story seemed too babyish for the ages of the characters. They didn't speak like kids their age. I don't think my son could relate, even though he also has an older sister, just like Albert. He did like Tilda Pinkerton, who sported a tall hat with a fishtank in its center. She was quite original! 
 The book includes and introduces many new vocabulary words for each chapter and some of the words seemed too advanced for this type of story. The story sometimes came across as contrived, as if each sentence had to include a certain number of adjectives and big new words, but this came at the expense of plot and character development. 
 I think the author's idea is a good one--the introduction of vocabulary words. However, I think there was too much emphasis on the words and not enough on the story. Kids learn new words when they love a good story. When I wanted to read and look over the new words at the end of each chapter, my son refused and just wanted to move on. The message of the story is a good one. With the help of magical hats, a family pulls together their ideas and creates beautiful things.

 Okay, first things first. This is a BABY book. For babies. No kid over the age of 4 is going to like it. 4 might even be pushing it. This is the kind of book your five-or-six-year old picks up for her 2-year-old brother because she loves him and wants to read to him. So, to reiterate, it's FOR BABIES. 
 It's all about hugging. All different kinds of hugging. 
 A catch-you hug is full of play, 
 although it takes your breath away. 
 A twirly hug will make you spin 
 and lift you up until you grin. 
 A friendly hug is nice and plain. 
 It's good to be with you again. 
 Each couplet is on a separate page with a picture of our hero - a zebra colt wearing clothes - enacting each hug with friends and/or family. For instance, the ""twirly hug"" takes place on a teacup fairgrounds ride. 
 The book is sweet. 
 A cheer-up hug can save the day 
 when everything is not okay. 
 Baby rabbit let go of his balloon and it is flying away, and he gets a hug from his parent to make it better. 
 A calming hug will see you through 
 when something scary frightens you. 
 Zebra colt helps baby bunny climb the tall ladder to the slide. 
 All the animals are wearing clothes. I find this very improbable. Also, some choose to wear shirts and some choose to wear pants. It's strange. They walk on their hind legs like humans. They wear backpacks and drink sodas and push strollers. Most of the animals are herbivores, but we do see an occasional bear in the background.

The Giver has chosen Jonas to take over his position as ""Receiver"" of all memories, driven by feelings. Until now, citizens followed strict protocol to ensure harmony within the community, but WHAT IF they were given the ability/permission to exercise free will while feeling the whole range of emotions? Until now, emotions had been only accessible, in their entire spectrum, to being felt by the Receiver. After Jonas discovers how his newfound abilities have changed his life, and decided that the potential gains were worth most resultant costs, life on the ""inside"" will never be the same again. 
 I'm eagerly awaiting the second book, with so much potential to continue this fascinating look at human nature. The possibilities are endless for plots, as new lives await all. 
 Extremely Highly Recommended for all book clubs, as The Giver crosses many genres. A brilliant gem, perfectly paced and the characters so well drawn I will miss them until I read the continuation of their plans.

"328",328,"1985's The Milk Makers ably illustrates what happens when promotion of an industry melds with children's literature. The result can best be described as, well, ""truthiness."" 
 The book opens with a few Holsteins grazing on a verdant pasture. 
 Cows are grazing in an open meadow. They are dairy cows, the milk makers. 
 If only. Well again, maybe this was an accurate picture considering the date of publication of this book. The blog Counting Animals writes of the American dairy industry: 
 The percentage of cows in large operations with 1000 or more cows has risen steadily from 0 in 1992 to 44% in 2010. 
 (Mega-dairies don't graze cattle but rather crowd them into feedlot facilities.) 
 The book goes on to note: 
 Other animals make milk, too. But dairy cows make most of the milk we use. 
 The three ""other animals who make milk"" pictured are a goat, a sheep, and a reindeer. How silly. Every mammal species, including those of the human variety, are capable of making milk. It's one of the major things that defines us as, well, mammals! 
 A cow is able to make milk when she is two years old and has given birth to a calf. Her milk is the food for her baby. She makes more than the calf will ever need--so we use the extra milk. 
 Now you're just lying. It is true that selective breeding and feeding programs have turned the dairy cow into an animal that produces far more milk than it ever would in nature. But the idea that we're just using the ""extra"" milk after Bossie Jr. gets her fill is ridiculous. On any sort of dairy operation that hopes to make money, the calf will be removed from the cow soon after birth. If the author spent any time on dairy farms researching this book, she would be aware of this standard industry procedure. 
 The only illustration in the book that hints at anything amiss in the dairy industry is one in which cows kept in a stanchion barn for winter are shown tightly chained in little stalls. Animals chained in such a manner would not be able to turn around or even take a few steps forward or backward. Here's a real photo of one such operation. 
 After lots of discussion of how milk is processed after it leaves the farm, we get this on the last page: 
 Milk is a nutritious drink that makes our bodies strong and healthy. 
 I'd correct that by saying that milk is a somewhat nutritious but non-essential drink that a large portion of the Earth's population cannot digest properly. Despite the claims of some, it has no magical properties, but it is over-produced to the nth degree and shows up as an ingredient in just about everything. And at the end of the day, that's why most of us still use milk products. 
 Also, lying is wrong.",1,0.1,0.391,0.735,1.27

"369",369,"Beware: Overanalyzation of a children's book ahead. 
 I grew up on these books, they were some of the first that I ever read by myself. Now that we're looking to expand our little family, I thought it was about time to re-read these precious books, in preparation for bed-time stories. 
 The first three, at least, were not as adorable as I remember. Catundra in particular was actually a little startling. 
 Basically you have a very fat cat (proper term here is obese) who learns to love herself only after losing weight and becoming slim, fit, and beautiful. 
 Now, I'm not against the exercise moral. If one's weight is affecting their health then of course diet and exercise will help you find it again, and I'm sure it was very nice for Catundra to be able to walk again without nearly passing out, but I'm unsure how I feel about reading a story to my children where the ONLY solution for Catundra to be happy and for the other woodland animals to like her was to become pretty. ""The other animals will stop laughing at you if you slim down."" comes the sage advice from the little mole. 
 Basically what we're saying here is: ""It's your fault you're fat, so it's your fault you're getting bullied. Stop being fat and you won't be bullied anymore."" 
 I get the being healthy moral, but I think it was lost a little in the thinly veiled social disgust for heavy people. If the forest animal's parents had taught them to mind their manners and not bully others, they wouldn't have laughed at Catundra when she was just a ""little"" heavy, thus Catundra wouldn't have become so isolated and depressed that she ate to hide her feelings and became ""a lot"" heavy. 
 Really, the moral of this story should be ""Don't be an asshole to other people."" 
 I originally thought that I'd leave this one out of the bed-time story collection for my kids, but then I wrote this review and now I think it's a great way to introduce the concept of ""how not to behave towards others.""",2,0.021,0.027,0.651,1.26
"945",945,"Hummingbirds Facts and Folklore in the Americas 
 Take a peek into the intriguing world of hummingbirds and go on a learning adventure. Not just for nine- to-twelve-year-olds, this book will appeal to teachers, parents, birders, and anyone interested in discovering more about hummingbirds. 
 Author Jeanette Larson provides insights into this diminutive bird's aerial acrobatics, biology, and historical cultural role. She vividly discusses how they ""fly with their body held upright, unlike other birds, which fly parallel to the ground....and propel themselves backward, right and left, and even upside down."" Statistics add impact to the explanations. For example, "" Hummingbirds start their flight before even leaving their perch. After only three wing strokes, they are almost at top speed, all in 7 /1,000 of a second! 
 Readers will relish Adrienne Yorinks' stunning mixed media quilt illustrations. Ms. Yorinks' masterfully brings the hummingbird's story to life. Her beautifully rendered quilt illustrations also show a variety of habitats, plants, and animals. 
 Ms. Larson deftly unravels the mysteries of the hummingbird by explaining the science behind its abilities, behaviours, migration and ecological role as a pollinator. She weaves nonfiction text with ancient folklore to reveal the hummingbird's historical role in symbolism, beliefs, and culture. These delightful legends also reveal how native cultures explained the extraordinary bird's size, abilities, speed, etc. 
 The book's conclusion offers a brief explanation about human-caused threats to hummingbird survival. A listing of conservation organizations, provided in the back pages, will be useful for those interested in environmental stewardship projects. A listing of websites that offer learning activities are included. One site has a hummingbird camera and audio of the variety of sounds different species make. The backmatter has a handy glossary and resources for further exploration. 
 The book Hummingbirds Facts and Folklore in the Americas will supplement a unit on wildlife and ecosystems throughout the Americas. It will also make a valuable addition to classroom, school, home, and community libraries. The book's artwork, charming folklore, and scientific facts will engage readers and whet their appetite for more explorations.",5,0.357,0.826,0.986,1.258

The idea of writing a board book about foreign cuisine so the concept is accessible to pre-readers is creative and adventurous, showing a willingness to help educate toddlers on unfamiliar subjects even if the books will never be runaway bestsellers.

"318",318,"Chiarisco subito: il pessimo voto non si riferisce al libro, che ho sempre adorato e che e un motivo conduttore di tutta la mia vita, ma a tutta quest'edizione che ho trovato agghiacciante. 
 Ci ho messo un secolo a rileggerlo, e mi sono stupita perche mi ricordavo dell'entusiasmo che mi aveva invece animato alle letture di altre edizioni molti anni fa, poi ho controllato il testo in inglese, avvilita dalla quantita di battute non riuscite, e ho capito che il problema era tutto li. 
 Partivo tutto sommato fiduciosa con la traduzione di Aldo Busi, lo ritengo un uomo di cultura, ma il lavoro che ha fatto su questo magnifico testo e orribile. Ha reso tutti i sottili, intelligenti e bellissimi giochi di parole di Carroll battute degne della barzelletta: 'Un uomo entra in un caffe - splash'; ha usato forme dialettali incomprensibili ad un eventuale bambino, modi di dire che probabilmente usa soltanto lui, parole che non vorresti mai che tuo figlio memorizzasse. Ad esempio, il noto 'Via la testa' o 'Tagliategli la testa' della Regina diventa 'Boia, un bel zac', vocaboli come 'boiakan' (se ricordo bene come l'ha scritto) sono tra i piu ricercati, quindi lascio solo immaginare il resto. Un orrore, sia per gli adulti, che ricercano quei delicati equilibri tra fantasia e intelletto che caratterizzano l'opera, sia per i bimbi, che non possono davvero memorizzare frasi cosi estranee al loro linguaggio e cosi poco evocative. 
 Anche le note sono ridicole: un libro che ha avuto migliaia di interpretazioni di tutti i tipi viene commentato con mezza paginetta di note per capitolo, sempre quando ci siano. 
 Insomma, in questo caso la traduzione e stata, secondo me, un vero tradimento dello spirito originale: si e persa la favola/fiaba (giacche l'originale e entrambe le cose) e alla fine della lettura non resta nessuna espressione in mente, nessun passaggio da annotare: solo la voglia di cercare una versione migliore, piu fedele non tanto o non solo al lessico, quanto allo spirito di Carroll, che qui e assolutamente assente.",1,0.233,0.2,0.791,1.182

"753",753,"""The Way Home in the Night"" is a beautiful, traditionally illustrated book written and illustrated by Akiko Miyakoshi, originally published in Japan in 2015. Fans of Miyakoshi will recognize the distinctive style from ""The Storm"" and ""The Tea Party in the Woods"". ""The Way Home in the Night"" is the simple story of a family walking home through their city at night. During their journey, the child observes the surrounding world and notices all the little details that makes this night special. Even when the child's head hits the pillow, the little bunny things about how the other animals' nights might be progressing, changing, and ending. Miyakoshi's use of perspective in the various scenes takes this book from average to exceptional, providing many dramatic viewpoints which seem completely natural and appropriate for the setting. The palette is muted and helps to convey the greyness that is a city at night. ""The Way Home in the Night"" is perfect for a bedtime story, one-on-one sharing, or even large group sharing in a school or library setting. The relatively short text broadens the potential audience and the details in the illustrations will engage a slightly older audience. This is another very satisfying title from Miyakoshi.

"695",695,"Review originally posted on my blog 
 I don't read too many Middle Grade novels but after I heard that there was one based on Jack and the Beanstalk, I immediately added it to my list of ""must read retellings."" Liesel Shurtliff takes a wonderful twist on the original story and creates a unique adventurous tale. Jack is an engaging book with fantastic world-building and it will take you on a brilliant journey. 
 Jack, whose mother constantly refers to him as a ""naughty little boy,"" believes he is destined for great things. After all, he is named after his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, who is known for bringing down nine giants. Jack's father has told him all about his grandfather's heroism but Jack longs to go on an adventure of his own. He doesn't expect that much will happen on his small farm, especially since giants are regarded as a myth. Soon enough, Jack's opportunity to live up to his name arises when giants begin to attack his village and kidnap his father to their land above the clouds. Jack is determined to retrieve his father and so he goes on an adventure with Annabelle, his younger sister, to the giant's land. 
 Jack is a fantastic narrator -- he's funny, engaging, and quite teasing. Although he loves to cause mischief and trick others at the start of the book, he greatly develops as a character and learns many lessons about his previous actions. Additionally, Jack is incredibly determined when it comes to finding his father; he constantly comes up with creative ways to get past hurdles in his path. I really adored Jack's younger sister, Annabelle -- she is super sweet and quickly learns to conquer her fears. She actually ends up playing a much larger role in the story than I expected and ends up helping save the day. 
 The world-building in this book is really well-done and extremely detailed. I was able to easily and vividly imagine the setting. I especially loved that Liesl focused on explaining even the smallest aspects of the giants' land (ex. various bugs and foods) and making the world incredibly unique.

Peter listens to his stern father--as he usually does--and throws Pax's favorite toy soldier into the woods. When the fox runs to retrieve it, Peter and his dad get back in the car and leave him there--alone. But before Peter makes it through even one night under his grandfather's roof, regret and duty spur him to action; he packs for a trek to get his best friend back and sneaks into the night. This is the story of Peter, Pax, and their independent struggles to return to one another against all odds. Told from the alternating viewpoints of Peter and Pax."" 
 My Review: I have been wanting to read this book, the cover is stunning and the story sounds like something right up my alley. I downloaded it on audio and Munchkin wanted to listen too, admittedly this book is well advanced for him. Being as I was listening with Munchkin and could only listen to about 15-20 minutes a day, this story took a very long time to finish. The writing is very descriptive and for someone who is younger several of the descriptions really didn't make sense to him, as an adult I enjoyed it but for the target audience that is often on that become a reader or start to hate reading it was maybe a bit much. I did enjoy the characters though and the way each of them developed. The story does tackle some tough subjects from war and PTSD to finding who you are and what is important to you as an individual. The ending was a little lackluster for all the build up and Munchkin kept asking what happened to the war, how did Peter get home, where did he go home? So we were left a little disappointed and almost bored with the ending, it is too bad because it had some really great developments.",3,-0.085,-0.235,-0.59,1.01

"847",847,"Balloons Over Broadway: The True Story of the Puppeteer of Macy's ParadeMelissa Sweet 
 ""Every little movement has a meaning of its own."" - Tony Sarg 
 Whether we watch it or not, most of us cannot recall a time when Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade was not an established part of the holiday season. Balloons over Broadway is the story of innovative puppeteer Tony Sarg's involvement with Macy's and his creation of the iconic balloon characters that populate the famous parade. 
 Sarg became a marionette man at the tender age of six by devising a rope and pulley system that allowed him to feed the chickens without getting out of his cozy bed. He simply loved deciphering how things worked. After moving to London as an adult, Sarg discovered that puppetry was a fading art form and decided he was just the man to revive it. He taught himself to make puppets, and then experimented until his marionettes' movements were as smooth and authentic as a human actor's would be. Sarg's fame grew as word spread of his incredible marionettes and their expressive, lifelike performances. He moved to New York City and began performing on Broadway. R.H. Macy was so impressed that he asked Sarg to create something spectacular for his next project: a holiday parade that would honor the festival traditions of the store's many immigrant employees and celebrate the American holiday of Thanksgiving. Thanks to Tony Sarg's incredible imagination and skill, awed audiences still gather to see beloved characters march along New York City's famous skyline in Macy's parade. 
 Caldecott Honor Winner Melissa Sweet's brilliant mixed-media collages combine with her endearing watercolors to evoke a respectful, affectionate scrapbook celebrating the wit, humor, and whimsy of Tony Sarg and his many ingenious creations. Sweet's collages -- fashioned of fabric bits, found objects, and handmade toys and dolls -- add texture, depth, and a sense of fun that reaches off the page, enticing the reader to examine each detail with care. Sweet's prose is engaging and informative, pulling the reader into the story of Sarg and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. She outlines the difficulties that arose, shaped the design and creation of Sarg's massive marionettes, and the improvements that followed. 
 Sweet's playful illustrations depict her story, but more than that, each page is rife with details that enhance the reader's understanding of Tony Sarg and the joy he found in creating his toys and puppets. Sarg's belief, ""I have never done a stroke of work in my life,"" resonates throughout the book, emphasizing that, for Sarg, work was play, and his life's work was a labor of love. Among the busiest artists of his day, Sarg always found time for his favorite audience - children. He personally replied to every single letter he received. Balloons over Broadway is a gorgeous, enjoyable book perfect for bedtime at home, storytime at school, or research for a project.

""You can see it out the window,"" Maxine said. ""But you have to stand with your head in that corner."" ""But there is a chest of drawers in that corner,"" Nick said.

"485",485,"Auf ""Hallo Leben, horst du mich?"" bin ich gestossen, weil das Buch laut Verlag besonders Leser von John Green ansprechen soll. Da ich ein grosser Fan von John Green bin, hatte ich deshalb enorm hohe Erwartungen an die Geschichte und muss sagen, dass ich letztendlich doch enttauscht wurde. 
 Zwar ist die Geschichte an sich nicht schlecht, mir allerdings viel zu einfach gehalten. Laut Verlag ist das Buch fur Leser ab 12 Jahren geeignet, hier hatte ich jedoch vermehrt das Gefuhl, als ware es eher ein Kinder- statt ein Jugendbuch, denn der Autor besitzt einen sehr einfach gehaltenen Schreibstil, der doch insgesamt sehr anspruchslos ist. Die Geschichte liest sich zwar an sich leicht und flussig, aber dennoch habe ich mir hier auch aufgrund der Thematik mehr Anspruch gewunscht. 
 Die Geschichte ist dabei schnell erzahlt: Der 11-jahrige Alex ist oftmals sehr allein, da seine Mutter krank ist und sich nicht um ihn kummern kann. Dabei kommt ihm die Idee, dass er seinen iPod ins Weltall schiessen mochte, um Aliens die Erde zu erklaren. Zusammen mit seinem Hund Carl begibt er sich auf eine Reise, um an einer Convention teilzunehmen, bei denen Menschen zusammentreffen, die ebenfalls grosses Interesse an dem Weltall haben. Dass er dabei auf die verschiedensten Menschen trifft und die ein oder andere Freundschaft schliesst, bleibt dabei auch nicht aus. 
 An sich ist die Grundidee des Autors nicht schlecht, allerdings konnte mich die Umsetzung nur wenig begeistern, da mir oftmals der Anspruch und die Tiefe gefehlt hat, die das Buch bitter notig gehabt hatte. Alex wirkt mit seinen elf Jahren oftmals sehr unreif und ich hatte stellenweise das Gefuhl, als ware er deutlich junger, was die Geschichte fur mich unglaubwurdig machte. Selbiges gilt leider auch fur alle anderen Figuren, die fur mich bis zum Schluss unnahbar blieben. 
 Das Cover ist dagegen wunderschon und hat mich direkt angesprochen, sodass ich neugierig wurde und mehr erfahren wollte. Gleiches gilt auch fur die Kurzbeschreibung, die sehr gelungen ist und aus der man das Beste herausgeholt hat. Sehr schade, dass das Buch letztendlich nicht mithalten konnte. 
 Kurz gesagt: ""Hallo Leben, horst du mich?"" hatte so gut sein konnen, allerdings hat mir der oftmals viel zu anspruchslose Schreibstil und die unnahbar, stellenweise unreifen Figuren, die Geschichte kaputt gemacht, sodass ich leider nicht begeistert bin und somit auch keine Leseempfehlung aussprechen kann.",2,-0.533,-1,-0.998,0.934

"714",714,"Chester's Back by Melanie Watt is the sequel to Chester. In all of these books, Chester the cat tries to edit or out-right rewrite Watt's books. He makes his ""edits"" in red marker pen and nothing is sacred. 
 In Chester's Back Chester doesn't want to star in a fairy tale that starts the same old way: ""Once upon a time..."" and decides that a cave cat story would be better. When that doesn't work he tries other costumes and settings. 
 The Chester books are a lot like the old Warner Bros.' classic, Duck Amok. In it, Daffy Duck is trying to act in a short but the animator keeps getting in his way by changing his costume, changing the scenery or worse. Chester's a little different in that he's in the book and aware of his status as a picture book cat. It's not so much that Melanie is getting in his way as he is getting in her way.

 Judy has a distinctive illustrative style, which flows through into this book.

Although the girls don't have the same fabulous twin powers, they are very astute with technology. The twins team up to solve a 200 year old murder and stop another crime (that only the reader knows about) from happening. 
 More silly than exciting, the boys' special twin skills make it too easy for them to outwit, fool and play pranks and also to figure things out. No time or need for the reader to play along. I rolled my eyes a lot, although I did appreciate the literary references, however, this 2nd book in the series didn't hold my interest long.

 Premise/plot: Mitzi Tulane is a preschool detective. Helping her out on this case, and maybe all her cases, is her doll Gigi Gaboo. In this first adventure, Mitzi is trying to detect what the GOOD smell coming from the kitchen is. Will Mitzi be the last in her house to know what's going on? Maybe, maybe not. Baby Kev isn't much in the know either. 
 My thoughts: I liked it okay. But I didn't love, love, love it. I find it hard to believe that Mitzi is really so very, very clueless that it's her birthday. That being said, this one has some cute elements in it. I liked seeing what Gigi Gaboo was doing on each two-page spread.

 The other thing is the variation of the story used was rather a lengthy and boring story altogether. Upon reading the story you just wanted to put the book down and walked away while finding a much better retelling.

Sjalv gillar jag sno. Inte den har slaskiga gra varianten vi har nu, utan nar det ar vitt och glittrigt och kallt. Nar det knarrar under sulorna och ryker ur munnen, den sortens sno (och vinter) gillar jag. 
 Oavsett, fick snon mig att tanka pa sagan Snodrottningen av H. C. Andersen. Jag vet inte hur manga som laser den har (ratt langa) sagan idag, men jag tyckte mycket om den som liten. 
 Snodrottningen handlar om en spegel. En spegel som forvrider allt som speglas i den. Det goda krymper och forsvinner, vackra landskap ser ut som kokt spenat genom spegeln. Trollet som uppfunnit den tycker den ar vansinnigt rolig och bestammer sig for att flyga upp med spegeln till Gud. Han blir dock sa full i skratt av blotta tanken att han tappar den och spegeln gar i miljoner bitar. Da blev det annu varre eftersom spegelskarvorna fastnade i folks ogon, eller till och med hjartan och satt dar och forvred syn och kanslor. 
 Kaj och Gerda ar grannar och basta vanner. De alskar varandra. En dag fastnar en spegelskarva i Kaj och hans hjarta blir som en isklump, sa nar Snodrottningen kommer och vill att han ska folja med henne gor han det. Alla tror att Kaj dott. Gerda med. Men solskenet, blommorna och floden haller inte med och till sist lyssnar Gerda pa dem. Hon bestammer sig for att hitta Kaj och ger sig ut pa en bade lang och farlig resa. 
 Snodrottningen ar en RIKTIG saga. Om du inte stiftat bekantskap med den annu tycker jag du ska lasa om is, sno och kyla nu nar snon borjat falla.",0,0,0,0,0
