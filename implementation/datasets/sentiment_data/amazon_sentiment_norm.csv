15,"  Perhaps ten years ago I bought a pegboard hardware set that came with similar clips (I believe the set was also from Crawford as its hanging jars are a dead ringer for Crawford's current set).  The clips from that set worked beautifully at preventing hooks from lifting off (and falling into the inaccessible muck behind my workbench).\n\nBut that set did not contain enough of the clips and I finally decided to look for more.  This item looked right and despite being rather overpriced, I went ahead and bought it.  But these clips simply do not stay clipped.  I compared them with the older clips and found that the barbs that grab the pegboard are only half as wide (about 1mm, or a bit over 1/32\).  They are simply too narrow to hang on.  So shame on Crawford for not only overpricing but selling a downgraded and now ineffective item, summary: Not the same as the old clips:  These don't work!, unixReviewTime: 1384560000}

We watched a few videos online and used the recommendation to start looking for the joists next to duct-work for our central air vents. We hit it on the first try and measured over 16 inches from the first joist to find the subsequent ones. We put the screws every 6 inches or so all along the joists, and did three joists in total. During the instal we had issues with some of the screws snapping off too early and had to use vice grips to get them out of the floor. After quite the project her floors still squeek just as badly as before. This product made absolutely no difference in the squeeking. I was really disapointed becuase it seems to get great reviews, it wasn't too difficult to do but it was time consuming. Now we will just have to wait until she gets conditioned to the sound of squeeky floors so it doesnt wake her up, and in the meantime we are learning a \path\ out of her room with minimal squeeks.

These are not returnable/exchangeable with Amazon, so I contacted the vendor.  They asked that I send the can back, and sent me a replacement.  The replacement arrive damaged (the metal construction of the can is very thin, and the packaging is apparently not sufficient to protect the can without being double-boxed).  Eagle cheerfully sent me yet another can (also not double-boxed), which also arrived dented, but no so much so that I'm concerned about its safety.\n\nThe good:\n - made in USA\n - can pour faster than the Justrite can\n - stiffer, stronger feeling spout that can be quickly removed (compared to the Justrite)\n - good customer service from Eagle\n\nThe bad:\n - the pour valve is somewhat awkward to use, and as you pull on the handle to open it, the whole top of the can flexes quite a bit (disturbingly so) -- I find the design of the Justrite can to be much easier to use\n - the pour handle also awkwardly jams into the filler cap lever, which opens it slightly, which helps make the can pour more quickly and easily, but it seems like a bit of a kludge\n - the pour valve on one of my cans has become stiff to operate, making it harder to open, and causing the can to bend even more.  I am concerned that the seam where the valve attaches to the can may eventually leak, or snap off of the can altogether\n - the filler cap is made of sharp sheet metal that is uncomfortable to open and hold while filling the can\n\nIn summary, I also purchased Justrite Accuflow cans, and prefer them in almost every way.

The other problem is that there is no bag actually designed to reach the bottom of the vacuum, so that as the bag fills up, it ends up hanging on the inlet causing pressure on the paper and eventually ripping open blowing all the debris\\dust all over the place. Those disposable wrap around paper filters that go over the foam sleeve clog up way too fast. Another problem is that housing just below the motor that is supposed to hold the foam sleeve directly interferes with the inlet leaving no room even if there was a tall bag that could reach the bottom of the vacuum offering support as debris collects and not putting pressure on the bag opening.

I used it for both on my hardwood floors and it simply did not have the weight/power to do the job. It could spread the wax on the floor, however it did a poor job of buffing out the floors.\nWithin twenty minutes of use, the \U\ bar on the handle bent and this disabled the unit to turn off without unplugging.\n The felt pads that came with the unit were flimsy and popped off the unit when in use.\n I could smell the unit overheat after about the first ten minutes- this makes me wonder how long it is going to last.\n Overall:\nIf you have small floor cleaning jobs using standard floor cleaners, it can do the job, at least for a while.

There is a \sensitive\ setting, which helps a bit, but on the truly sensitive days, I just turn it off entirely and use it like a non-power toothbrush. A little ridiculous, no?\n\nI've tried smaller, cheap, AA-battery-powered brushes, and they don't seem to hurt. Granted, they don't clean nearly as powerfully either.

The single stream no longer exists and instead the bottle will spray just as if you unscrewed the nozzle completely. The nozzle seems to come apart in the middle so one wouldnt even notice what was going on until they sprayed.\n\nEverything else is great, the size, the style, the power of the stream. But 6 bottles breaking. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Coming from separate orders. (I placed multiple). There is a reason this squirt bottle is not 5 stars when all it needs to do is operate properly.

But I'll never order this product again.\n\nIf you see any reviews that reflect otherwise then the chances are it is just a person who wrote their review quickly and did not come back to update it after the bottles failure.

543,"  After seeing delivery guys use similar straps to deliver refrigerators and other heavy items I decided to find these to help with a move I was doing.  In the end I only used them a couple times as I found it easier and quicker to just use brute strength than to climb in this and then strap up to the item.  The straps did help some when I used them, for example I used it to move an antique Philco fridge that is solid metal throughout.  While it allowed us to lift the fridge and it held the weight, the straps dug into our shoulders really bad and made it extremely uncomfortable to carry any distance.  The other drawback as stated by others, is climbing stairs.  Unless you go side by side, the weight will fall toward the lower person, and the difference in height causes the item to hit the stairs.  This was the main reason I ended up using two hands to move items instead of these.  If I had to run a race on flat ground while carrying a fridge with someone else, then these would be what I would use.  Seriously though, these really are limited to lifting heavy items without a place to grab onto and where using a dolly would potentially cause damage.

Goes great with drinking while moving things.\n\nI live in a second floor in-law apartment (above the garage) and recently had the washing machine die.  From experience getting appliances/furniture into the apartment is a hassle (it's not that the stairs are narrow... it's that they are there) so I though we'd give these a shot. Delivery was prompt (have to love Prime) and use is super simple: Put harness on with buckle facing your front, thread strap under the middle of the load, cinch strap to the buckle, stand up. We did a test run with the old dryer (very light but large) and found it to be very easy; the hardest part was going down the stairs (the person on the bottom still controls most of the weight however the person at the top is helping take some of it as well as helping to balance) as the bottom person needs to have their strap cinched higher the the top person.  We then repeated the process with the washer (the heavy appliance) and found it's more an act of keeping the appliance balanced than anything! We were able to easily move the old appliances downstairs and into the truck as well as move the new stuff in under an hour with no break (okay, we found we could drink beer while moving the driers... sssh). The only real complaint we both had after all was said and done was that the straps need padding over the shoulder. The harness fits extremely well (we're both large guys; developed upper bodies with a few extra pounds so \large\ harnesses/shirts/etc never fit) and the buckle/strap combination is extremely easy to use.

659,"  I purchased this steamer primarily for gleaning the tile and grout in my bathrooms. This steamer is very easy to setup and use.  It does take around 10 minutes to heat up, and while this sounds a bit long to some people it is due to the nice large water tank within the steamer.  The steamer comes with an assortment of attachments, such as hard floor steam mop and various brushes.  As with other reviewers comments I did find that the nylon brushes did start to melt after prolonged use.  This is understandable due to the high temperature steam being produced.  You can NOT expect these brushes to last for more than a few uses.  Additional brushes can be ordered from steamfast and a regular subscription shipment can be set up as well (i.e. send 1 set every 3 months) with free shipping. Overall, this did a fabulous job on by tile and grout. If the brushes were a bit more durable I would have given it 5-stars.",4,0.314,0.528,0.938

It sucks up the water thoroughly (not leaving it soggy wet) and it cleaned the carpets really well.  It only has the one tank where you mix the hot water and the cleaning solution together, but the tank is large enough to finish an entire room (where we previously have had to refill once or twice to finish our living room).  The brushes seem to work really well and you could see where you had run the machine over the carpet, and where you had not.  This helped make the carpet feel softer after the entire process was done.  We vacuum the carpet, run the shampoo over the carpet with the cleaning solution, and then using a tank of just hot water, run the machine one more time, let the carpet dry and then vacuum.  It looks great when it's done, and since it sucks up the water really well it dries quicker than other machines we have used.  The cord did not get hot during use.

You need to make sure the threaded portion is free from any of the epoxy compound residue (especially the hardener) before recapping. I have had problems with \oil\ separation with the \Steel\ compound which makes me have to dispense more product than I need. I like the way the product flows as it dries leaving a smooth somewhat glossy finish.\n\nNote: Another epoxy product worthy of mention is \PC Products PC-7\. It has a completely different consistency; it is incredible sticky and I use it in situations where I do not want it to flow/drip. It does not flow as it sets but can be smoothed with a wet (isopropyl alcohol, or water moistened) finger tip.

744,"  We have a couple of dogs. Small dogs. And we have hardwood floors. You can probably guess what I'm going to say.\n\nYep, the dogs are about as trained as a circus monkey at a beauty salon. That is to say...hardly. So the accidents are numerous. As I was concerned they'd damage our new hardwoods (about 2k sq ft of them) I put down Bona Polish. Now, I read all the negative reviews about Bona Polish but I figured it'd be better to have that get damaged than the wood floor.\n\nSure enough the dogs pee on the floor, we wipe it up, it leaves a cloudy patch. Not a \stain\ but more like a spot where the pee and the bona mixed to create a thin haze. You can't just wax over the spot either.\n\nSo I read a review that said to use the Bona stripper and this little guy. Incidentally my wife read that Windex will work in lieu of the stripper.\n\nI ordered and when it arrived we tried it out.\n\nAssembly was easy\nQuality is about what you'd expect from a $100 floor scrubber. It just feels cheap. (The only reason I'm marking down 1 star)\nInstructions? Thin. One page. Fortunately I've used floor cleaners before so I knew you just put the pads against the brushes...you don't remove the brushes and attach the pads.\n\nWe sprayed some Windex on a cloudy patch, waited a minute, then ran the scrubber over it and wiped up the liquid with a towel. A perfectly dull area was left behind but there was no sign of the spot.\n\nWe applied the Bona High gloss polish and had success! The spot was gone.\n\nWe hurriedly did the rest of the spots and other areas in the house where the Bona wasn't looking right and experienced equal success.\n\nSummary: if all you have is one or two small patches you can probably get by with just a green scrubby and Windex but the scrubber made short work of all that we had to do. I am currently planning on giving all my floors a quickly spritz and once over with the scrubber to help keep the Bona from building up. I figure about once every couple of years should be good.\n\nNote: when you run the scrubber new it puts off a decidedly \electrical equipment\ smell. I can't put my finger on it but it wasn't unpleasant. if you aren't expecting it you might be concerned. The unit didn't get hot or burst into flames so I'm going to assume the smell is normal.

So tonight i did a second layer but with original jb weld and will post that review as well. It will be on until a new radiator arrives in 3-5 days. I recommend giving it only 1 or 2 trys.

If you want to empty the entire 5 gallons of gas it will take some time with the smaller nozzle that is provided with the can.  I understand a larger diameter nozzle can be purchased but the price was high, about $17 plus shipping.\n\nThe can arrived with the dent (only cosmetic) as mentioned in other reviews.

778,"  I recently engaged in a nutrition and workout program with an aim a reducing body fat and gaining muscle.  The best way to know if you are making progress is by monitoring your body fat.  While there are many expensive methods for determining your body fat, utilization of calibers are the cheapest method with some level of accuracy.  The important part is to make sure you use them in a consistent fashion (location of the fold on the body, position of the caliper jaws on the skin, and time frame after releasing the jaws to take the reading) when measuring the skin fold.\n\nThe Slim Guide Skin Fold Calipers work as advertised and expected.  Just press the trigger which opens the jaws then place the calipers in position and release the trigger.  The spring will provide the appropriate force while you read the measurement.  Some measurements will require the use of another person (like triceps and back) to perform the measurements.  The small numbers can be hard to read if you are doing the measurement yourself.\n\nThe calipers are made of plastic but appear to be pretty durable (I dropped them a couple of times on the tile floor while taking measurements).\n\nOverall, and excellent product and does the job, just wish the numbers were a little bigger.",4,0.333,0.647,0.971

847,"  Arctic silver 5 as a thermal compound is one of the best thermal pastes for cooling a CPU, Ive used this specific thermal paste for two of my pc builds. Ive done some research and this performs slightly better than many other brands. It is important to note that the differences mentioned here are approximately a few degrees differences. Its notable to mention also that although its only a few degrees in improvement the price is barely noticeable and there's enough in this tube for probably 2 applications. A few simple steps to apply\n\n1. Remove the old thermal compound. You can do this by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.\n\n2. Apply a surface cleaner. You can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit. Make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.\n\n3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. Try not to apply so much that when you apply the heat sink it spills excessively to the side. If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip.  Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A card actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.\n\n4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly. I brought a cooler master heatsink with the screwless design, just jab it in and it sticks there.",5,0.276,0.077,0.959

I add the caveat for the hands-free part because you still have a heavy piece of furniture pivoting on a nylon strap- you can take a hand off and still steady the load, but two hands at the same time might be pushing it.\n\nThis was worth the money, it worked as expected, the quality was equal to the task and I would gladly buy this again.",5,0.143,0.347,0.897

I don't verify the factor of six, but the tape does seem to hold up pretty well.\n\nIf you need a roll of duct tape for cosmetic work, then this is your tool of choice.\n\nSingle rolls and short rolls (2104 in 3M part language) are also possibilities depending on the size of the project.",5,0.333,0.961,0.939

If the applicator is not attached properly, fluid will leak all over the place...hands, equipment, etc.  I will say that the applicator is difficult to attach properly.  I found that a fair amount of pressure is needed to properly seat the applicator's threads to the bottle's neck threads.  Once seated properly and then twist (screw) the applicator onto the bottle it's leak-proof.  It does take some practice to secure the applicator to the bottle...most people think that the applicator just doesn't fit because it takes effort to seat the threads.  Twist caps normally easily engage..this cap takes some effort and pushing. I do like the needle applicator ..it allows precise application to areas (rollers) which need to be cleaned.
