 Following my previous dissatisfaction with the ending of the first book, I headed down to my nearest library and checked out the rest of the series. So now I'm all equipped to find out just what the hell is going on in this town. I had an initial thought at first that Stain'd-by-the-Sea was a tiny place, but I guess I was wrong if Mr Snicket could still bring in more buildings and characters that weren't introduced in the first book (even if the town was dying and partly abandoned), but hey I ain't complaining. I'm just glad that my favourite taxi drivers and little journalist are back for more detective action, because they are so cute. 
 This book was more complete in the sense that the mystery of the missing girl was actually solved. I was almost terrified that Mr Snicket would let the girl slip through his clutches one more time and I think I might have thrown the book out of the window and paid the library fines for 'losing' the book after that. So yes I was quite satisfied with the ending. And also distracted by the lack of the mention of the Bombinating Beast, which had plagued me throughout the first book. 
 I am beginning to see the similarities between this series and ASOUE and it delights me to no end.",4,-0.529,-0.731,-0.773
6,"In this book, Dorothy learns that the family farm is about to be lost and she and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are about to become homeless. Dorothy's aunt and uncle have heard all of the tales from Dorothy's previous trips to Oz, but they always thought that it was just tales from her imagination. 
 Upon learning that they are going to be homeless soon, Dorothy signals Ozma and goes back to Oz. She explains the situation that they are in and Dorothy tells her that she is going to take the offer to live in Oz forever, but would like to bring her aunt and uncle there. Ozma agrees to this request and brings the rest of the family there. 
 Uncle Henry and Aunt Em have never seen anything like Oz before and being that they are guests in the Royal castle, are a bit out of their comfort zone. To make them more comfortable, Ozma sends them and Dorothy out into the country to meet some of the residents of Oz. They meet some very odd characters along the way and they are always interesting. There are some characters that remind me of Alice in Wonderland. 
 Meanwhile, while all of this is going on, the Nome King has decided that he wants his magic belt back and he's going to plan an attack on the Emerald city and get it back. He loses several of his General's for his army, but one brave man, Guph, is happy to step up and take the role. He visits several evil groups of things and makes them promises and they agree to attack. While Guph is out gathering forces, the Nome King and his servants make a tunnel under the desert that separates his kingdom from Oz. 
 In the end, Ozma decides not to fight the Nome King. She wins the battle in an interesting way. You'll have to read to find out. Then, she and Dorothy and friends all visit Glenda the Good and they make it so that no one outside of Oz can get in or find it by accident or just fly in and take things over.

 I really enjoy this world, their characters and their adventures, but I had a lot of issues with this book. It took 25% in the book for the characters to go back into the Land of Stories, this book is supposed to be for middle grade... I would have been bored, had I been that age, and wouldn't have finish the book. The rest of the book was a bit slow for my taste. The Wand of Wonderment was supposed to be really important, but there were only one chapter to retrieve each item, so yeah... The pace was inappropriate. There are a lot of characters in these books, I had forgotten everything about some of them. It is important to have secondary characters, but not so many... For some of them, you get to know them in the first chapters, and then, nothing until the last one (like Mother Goose), it doesn't make sense. I still really enjoyed my reading and got a little tear-eyed toward the end. I don't know if I'll continue with this series though, because the books are too long for what they are.",3,1,0.201,0.934

 More a collection of short stories about one family than a complete novel, Little Men is a cosy and undemanding read. Victorian life comes through clearly. The whole thing smells of baked apples and gingerbread, sounds like childish laughter, and shines with the loving benevolence which is the entire principle of Aunt Jo's school. 
 Though not Alcott's best, it's still a must read for anyone who loves Little Women, particularly if you are planning to complete the set and read Jo's Boys as well. The latter is an excellent book and well worth a read, but makes very little sense if you've not previously read Little Men.

16,"Jennifer Holm has crafted a tender and well-written story for middle grade readers, full of real characters, humor, a bit of fantasy, and some powerful messages about life and growing up. Ellie is an eleven-year-old middle schooler, who is experiencing significant changes and losses: she misses elementary school, she misses her best friend, and she is unsure about her place in the big picture of middle school and life. Then one day, a gawky adolescent boy shows up on her doorstep who bears an extremely close resemblance to her grandfather Melvin--could it be true that he has made a fantastic scientific breakthrough and discovered the fountain of youth? 
 I was surprised by how much depth this novel had--there were many plot lines and several main themes woven deftly throughout the book. I think young readers, especially girls, will immediately connect with the main character of Ellie: she sounds like a 'real' kid, and is very relatable in her thoughts about life and growing up. The premise of the story, that Ellie's grandfather has found a way to reverse the aging process and is a 13-year-old again, makes for some humorous situations. Holm did such an excellent job with the major themes in the novel (the cycle of life, the importance and excitement of scientific discovery, and the belief in the possible). I would highly recommend this wonderful story about growing up to kids (and their parents and teachers!) 9 and up, who enjoy realistic fiction with a touch of fantasy.",5,2,2.001,0.992

 The Daring Book for Girls, by Andrea Buchanan and Miriam Peskowitz, is jam-packed with information every girl needs, like how to change a tire, how to conquer public speaking, and even how to survive in the wilderness. This book can be read front to back or can be used as an easy go-to reference. 
 While it's not the best reference book out there, the writing is fun and witty and the colorful art helps make this a very enjoyable read. 
 Interspersed with how-to articles are stories about famous women in history, women who have changed the world, and women who have gone on to achieve amazing things. Read about Cleopatra and her rise to fame, as well as Joan of Arc and her ultimate sacrifice to fight for what she believed in. 
 This isn't just a girl's guide to boy stuff...there's some girly stuff in there, too...like how to make friendship bracelets, how to make a daisy crown for your head, ideas for sleepovers, and there's even a list of books every girl should read. 
 Check this book out the next time you're in a bookstore. Also available is The Dangerous Book for Boys, as well as many other varieties.

21,"This is a great book that simultaneously amused and fascinated me. Filled with simple language, and perfectly chosen pictures, it gives children (and adults) insight into some of the more ewww-worthy animal behaviors, such as the reason behind nose-picking and feces-eating. There were several times when I was quite surprised because I had no idea that there were legitimate reasons for some of the behaviors (like the feces-flinging). 
 This is a perfect book for ages 8+ to read by themselves, but also easily one that parents would enjoy reading with them or younger children. The back of the book lists several 'scavenger hunts' which encourage the reader to utilize the internet and find out more information about various animal behaviors or adaptations on their own. 
 A fantastic read from Dawn Cusick and National Wildlife Federation that I would definitely recommend for any child who is curious about biology, or just at the stage where they think bodily functions are hilarious. It'll let them laugh and educate them at the same time. Great work.

 First up, the disclaimer: yes, I know Claire Legrand and she's awesome, but that did not influence my opinion of the book in any way. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Though I've had Claire's debut novel, The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls for over a year now, I've not managed to work it into my schedule, so I'm glad I've finally gotten to try her writing. Also, I'm pleased to say that I like her writing. Hurrah! Claire Legrand has written a beautiful, occasionally creepy story about a grumpy young girl who learns how to open up her heart and enjoy life again. 
 My second favorite aspect of The Year of Shadows is definitely the heroine. Olivia Stellatella is a delight, but which I mean she is a seriously grouchy, cynical kid. She may be young, but her life has been hard and it's getting more difficult by the time. First, her mom abandoned her, then her dad got completely caught up in trying to save the orchestra for which he conducts, and now her family (Olivia, The Maestro (Dad, though she never calls him that because he made mom leave), and Nonnie (grandma)) has moved into the concert hall, living in two little rooms and making do with the makeshift kitchen. Olivia hates that she's had to move here, worries that they won't have enough food to eat, and shops at the thrift shop. Even worse, she knows that, if the orchestra's ticket sales do not improve, it's done after this season, meaning they'll be even worse off because of The Economy. In other words, if this were a movie, Olivia would be played by either a young Winona Ryder or Christina Ricci. 
 Actually, that comparison is pretty accurate too. Much as I try to resist going too crazy with comparing books to other books or movies, I can't resist this time. There are a lot of parallels to Casper but with some of the creepiness of Beetlejuice, but, of course, with some magic totally unique to Legrand's vision. The ghosts are by turns horrifying and friendly. The shades pretty much reside in Creeptown, USA and Legrand's Limbo is haunting. 
 Now, let's go back. Remember how I mentioned that Olivia was my second favorite? Well, my favorite is Igor. He's this cat who adopts Olivia, though she might tell you it happened the other way round. Olivia fancies that he speaks to her, and imagines that his voice sounds very like Cary Grant. Igor's such a cat, with his helpful suggestions like this one: ""I know what will make you feel better. Petting me. Better yet, asking for permission to pet me"" (211). How can anyone not love a cat that just might talk like Cary Grant? Also, I credit Igor with getting the kids through everything and teaching Olivia how to love. He convinces her to give people another shot and nudges her in the right direction with his knowing cat ways. 
 Another aspect I adore is the music. In Claire Legrand's bio, it says that she ""was a musician until she couldn't stop thinking about the stories in her head."" Her love of music really shines in The Year of Shadows. Her descriptions of letting music wash over you are lyrical and moving. The dynamics of the band too are so apt, especially the depiction of the trumpet player. It's wonderful when authors can work in some of their real life passions, because that emotion seeps into those sections in a way that really shows. 
 The ghost story element is well done, especially for the intended audience. With each ghost, there's a little miniature story arc full of action and adventure, followed by a scavenger hunt of sorts, and what kid will not be all over that? I did have some minor quibbles with the way some of the logic worked, but, for the most part, I was able to sit back and enjoy the story. 
 Themes of family and friendship are also highly prevalent in The Year of Shadows. Though I think a lot of the right notes are struck here, I don't think they're held quite long enough or played with enough emotion. Legrand does a nice job establishing the friendship with Henry and Olivia, but their lunch table friend Joan comes and goes as is convenient in the story. Similarly, Henry never comes to any sort of realization about his bullying friend, though it seemed like that would be one of the impending plot points. With family too, resolutions seemed a bit too smooth and sudden, with the awkward moments skipped or glossed over. This might be a plus for younger readers, but I was hoping for those emotional wallops. Also, we're sort of left hanging on what's going to happen to Olivia next, and I'm wondering if she's going to be okay. 
 Claire Legrand's sophomore novel features lovely writing, both sassy and creepy ghosts, and a heartwarming tale of learning to let people in. The Year of Shadows is an excellent read for middle grade readers and for older readers who enjoy new twists on ghost mythologies.",4,1.197,0.41,0.999

73,"This has rapidly become one of my most favorite children's books of all time; I even liked it a whole lot more than The Little Prince. It's written in Spinelli's trademarked straightforward, from-a-child's-eye narration. With rich but simple vocabulary, it tells the story of David and Primrose, a clashing pair of friends who met in an unusual way during an Easter egg hunt. 
 There really is nothing agreeable between David and Primrose; they are exact opposites. David is a serious nine-year-old who has a strict habit of following rules since his mother had died. Primrose, on the other hand, is a thirteen-year-old who breaks every rule she's come face-to-face with, and has just recently moved out of her mother's house and is living in a van she's designed in their backyard. 
 Together they set out on an adventure to Philadelphia, but not after a couple of days fighting over random things, scraping eggs that other kids had thrown on Primrose's van's windows, collecting junk, and hunting for nightcrawlers. 
 The ending is so simple and touching, but doesn't promise a smooth-sailing friendship between the two, which is only as far as reality goes. It is a very light and page-turning read that you can indulge on for a few hours time. You'll be endlessly entertained by Primrose's sarcastic view on life and the naivety of David, who was only too young when he was exposed to the painful process of loss. They set out to find and change themselves, accomplish a few promises, and see the waving man of Philadelphia, in ways that only kids know of.",5,0.417,-0.251,0.8

76,"Wowowowow. 
 I'm so in awe right now. 
 This book resonated so deeply in my heart, and it had so many profound statements. I'm just...in shock. 
 Lovely Things: 
 - The characters. This book was chock full of vibrant, amazing characters. The author breathed life into this story through the heartbeat of every character. From the big-hearted Jonah Pickett to the hedgehog-collecting Cleo to the banjo-playing Boone and word-collecting Felicity, this whole story was alive. I don't know how to explain it. All the characters were just so real and distinct and wonderful. THEY WERE PERFECTION. <3 
 - The setting. Oh my goodness. This setting is about the most magical place in existence. Technically it just had a ""snicker of magic""...but Midnight Gulch is a place that you can't help but feel a part of when you read it. It screams, ""HOME"" and makes you want to sigh happily and stare at a starry sky. It's infused with everything that makes life beautiful. 
 - The writing. YES YES YES. I'm just here silently screaming because Natalie Lloyd's writing voice is fabulous. It's poetic and beautiful and profound...yet still simple and full of wonder and curiosity. I LOVE IT. 
 - The depth. I can't even tell you how much this story impacted me. WOWZERS. It just goes to show how powerful fiction is. 
 ""Everything you touch, everything you smell, everything you taste, every picture you see-- all of that has the potential to call up a sad memory. You can't choose what comes first. But you can choose to replace it with something good. I choose to think on the good parts."" 
 I think if you're lucky, a sister is the same as a friend, but better. A sister is like a super-forever-infinity friend. 
 Home isn't just a house or a city or a place; home is what happens when you're brave enough to love people. 
 That's a wonderful word: maybe. I watched maybe stretch out, long and starry. The letter y looked as fiery as the tail of a comet; it looped around our shoulders, connecting us all together. 
 Not So Lovely Things: 
 - Um...I'm drawing a blank here. I know there were a few instances of crude humor (using words like barf and fart and such), but other than that, not much to mention. 
 - I will mention just briefly that I didn't fully enjoy this book because I kept reading it in ""snippets."" I've been too busy to sit down and devour books so I probably didn't get the whole experience out of this. BUT STILL. This book was absolutely spindiddly. 
 Overall? I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK. Everyone, go get yourself a copy of A Snicker of Magic.

80,"Thanks to Goodreads friend Abigail who recommended I might continue considering giving this book a try, despite her rather lukewarm response to it and (perfectly valid) criticisms of it. I have an additional criticism to the ones Abigail listed, but its minor, very minor, and doesn't detract from the wonderful illustrations, which for me are the heart of the book. I'd have been happy had this been a wordless picture book! 
 The illustrations are incredibly lovely. They're all beautiful. I love illustrations by and of the sea and there were plenty of those. The illustrations of the cats were wonderful too. My favorite pictures though are probably the library one and the one at the end in Miss Rumphius's house with her, cats, and a bunch of children. Oh, and the one of her in bed and the one of her walking in her neighborhood with her cat following her. Etc. etc. etc. I can't single them out because almost all of them are special. In my opinion, the illustrations are 5 star worthy work. 
 I liked the story and the whole circle of life aspect. Alice Rumphius's grandfather is an artist and asks that she make the world a more beautiful place. Adventurous in her youth, when she's an older woman she finds a way to do that. (A caveat: despite her best intentions, lupine flowers are not benign; see Abigail's review.) She, in turn, asks her great niece (the narrator of this story) to do the same. It's a lovely little story that addresses living for both our hearts' desires and giving something back to the world. 
 From me it's 5 stars for the gorgeous pictures and 3-1/2 stars for the story.",4,2.263,1.363,0.998
81,"I actually stumbled on this book during our book fair, and it was purchased for my classroom by one of my students. The back copy looked intriguing, so I brought it home to read over Christmas break. 
 Wow. This book! It was so much more than I anticipated. It's magical realism at its very best. 
 In the current world, when someone is about to die, a cloud comes to them. When a cloud comes to Gracie's town, her father, who is a scientist, studies it for several days. And they all notice how the cloud gets closer and closer to their house. 
 So, the Lockwood family does the only thing they can do. They leave. They decide that they must outrun the cloud and keep her little brother, Sam, who has been ill a lot of his young life, safe. They decide they will try to go to the Extraordinary World. 
 The rest of the book is their journey. In this journey, they meet ghosts, sasquatches, dragons, mermaids, giants and many others. But it all works! Jodi Lynn Anderson has woven a world that is so believable that you feel your heart racing at times, and relief at many others.

But being an adult, and knowing what an utter struggle it must have been living the way the Ingalls' did, with three small children in Indian territory, and how a scene like this - pure bliss over a few small presents - must have meant so much to those adults ... well, I had to have a little cry about it.",5,1,0.636,0.873

Luckily for him, his frog friend pushes him back into the pond which he decides is exactly where he belongs. After all, as the tadpole had told him, ""Fish is fish"" (unpaged). This picture book is a gentle reminder that exploring the wider world isn't for everyone and that we need to be true to our innate nature.

It wasn't terrible, and I remember, not without fondness, my Dad reading it aloud when I was a kid. (I think he must have done a Princess Bride and edited, though. Elements of the story were there - the sky isle of Un, the half-a-lion, the minor character Mixtuppa who talks from behind a curtain - but it was not as I remembered it.) 
 To my adult ears, it almost feels like it tries too hard to throw in puns and humor and lots of drawn-out conversations that don't lend much to the story. (Why is the telephone-beak bird so enamored of Notta at first sight? Why does he talk about it so much?) In addition, Thompson's characters shout and scream and shriek a lot, which honestly made me feel like it must be awfully noisy in Oz. Does she not know any homonyms for talking in a normal voice? Or does she like noisy people? Who knows? I definitely would not want to visit Oz after reading just this book. It's ok(ish) but nowhere near the charm and inventiveness of Baum's books. The original Oz characters come across as super-bland, and the characters Thompson invents don't fair much better, being primarily cliches.

123,"Since some children are too difficult for the sweet-natured Mother Goose to handle, she sends these scoundrels to her sister, the much stricter Spinster Goose. The twenty-seven nursery rhymes that follow the misbehaving children are all, indeed, twists on the familiar Mother Goose rhymes. These aren't sweet little stories, but the author's own take on what should happen to those who don't know how to behave. There is much to enjoy in this collection as Bobby Shaftoe, Jack and Jill, and even Baa Baa Black Sheep get their just desserts. Although some of the vocabulary may be challenging, there are many lines that children and middle graders will enjoy repeating. I particularly loved the clever line on page 27 that ends ""The Dirty Kid"": ""Can't Spinster see this punk is into grunge?"" The ink and watercolor illustrations are rendered in soft colors, showing the sheepishness of ""The Loser"" who has left her clothing at home and poor confused Humpty Dumpty who ""hides in a stall""--a bathroom stall, that is.

124,"E ARC from Edelweiss Above the Treeline 
 Bilal's family must leave Pakistan suddenly after his father is arrested. His mother and two younger siblings are able to leave, but his father must wait for a visa. They move to Virginia, to stay with an aunt and uncle who have a teen boy, Jalaal. Since Bilal's main interest in Pakistan was playing cricket (and he was very good), his uncle signs him up right away for a baseball camp. Missing his father and finding that the English spoken by his teammate is very different from the English he learned in school, Bilal struggles to fit in. Another new kid on his baseball team, Jordan, also struggles. Since her father is deployed in Afghanistan and she would rather be back home in the midwest, she tries to make friends with Bilal, but the boys on the baseball team don't want a girl on their team, and make fun of Bilal when he hangs around her. School is difficult, and Bilal has to spend some time in an ESL unit, while his younger sister takes to the language much more quickly. Skype visits with his father are nice, but Bilal gets tired of waiting. When Pakistani cricket star and government hopeful Omar Khan comes to the US, Bilal jeopardizes his team's tournament success to get the man's attention, which is influential in getting his father back home. 
 Strengths: This had a lot of good details about what it is like to move to a different country. Skyping with his father, having to learn a new game, missing friends and life in his first country (and that's a helpful phrase to know) all are things that children in the US who were born here need to know about. I liked the inclusion of the cousin who was well-versed in the ways of the US, as well as the younger sister who settled in so much more easily. Using sports as a way to introduce this topic to readers is a great idea. 
 Weaknesses: I wish there had been more details about why his father was having trouble in Pakistan, and about cricket. 
 What I really think: I know that many people balk at the idea of people from other cultures writing from the perspective of a character from another culture. However, until we see more great writers like Gita Varadarajan, it's very helpful for my students to have diverse books written by writers who try to get the details correct and check them with people from the culture about which they are writing. I think Carol Marsden does a particularly good job, as does Lorenzi. I will be buying this.",3,0.828,0.987,0.997

127,"Samuel has lost his parents right before his eyes in a freak accident and he and his sister Martha have now been sent to live with their Aunt Eda in Norway. Eda lives in a remote area near a large forest. She has several rules, but the most important one is that the children must never enter the forest. Years ago, her beloved husband had entered the forest and never returned. Plus, there are odd goings-on in the forest. Strange creatures like trolls have been seen near it and huldres, grey-colored beings riding horses are sometimes spotted too. When Martha is drawn to the forest and enters, Samuel feels he has no choice but to enter the forest too to save her. In doing so, both children are caught in the evil created by the Changemaker, who has taken the forest's friendly beings and converted them into evil by controlling their shadows. 
 A fast-paced romp of a read, this book gallops along at a great pace, barely stopping for rabbit casserole before running on again. The characters are lovingly written, and the writer's asides within the book are charming and great fun. Haig even takes great joy in creating rather horrific deaths and harrowing situations, a skill that older child readers will greatly enjoy themselves.

Although not getting much information regarding the main plot is frustrating, I think the quality of the books and the stories has gone up since book #8, by miles. 
 There is no point in talking about the stories after book #5 because the change in the scope of the story is something readers should experience by reading the series of books. So I hope and request people to not put spoilers in their reviews of books later than #5. This is a very unique series and don't spoil it for others, especially anything and everything related to the abbreviation you-know-which.

137,"The Giver is absolutely deserving of its status as a modern classic (is it still modern or am I just old now?) and it does a lot of really interesting things. Most people I know read it in school growing up and it's hard for me to believe that I didn't (I would have been 6 when the book came out so it would have been around for a few years when I was the right age to read it), but I don't really have any memory of it. Whether or not I read it as a child I read it again, though this time I listened to it on audiobook so it was like a new story for me. 
 The Giver describes a dystopian future where everything is defined by ""Sameness."" People in this society expect everything to go exactly according to plan. They all follow the same rules, do the same things during the day at the same time, etc. This creates and very safe society. There is no violence, no need for locked doors - and no real emotions. Paths change slightly at age 12 when they are given their assignments for their adult careers, but still adults stick to the same rigid rules and protocol. Jonas has always been very comfortable in his society, until he turns 12 and receives his assignment. At that point his perspective on everything changes and his eyes are open to just how harmful this type of society can be. 
 Even though dystopian novels are super popular now (thanks to Hunger Games) I have to think that wasn't the case when The Giver came out so I think it's really fascinating to see the way that it introduces this topic to children. It feels creepy in just how ""normal"" everything seems. These people are still relatable to us - they've just found better ways to handle their emotions, supposedly. They don't have conflict as a result, and at first glance doesn't that sound like a better world? No war, no violence, no rageful disagreements? While it's certainly ""safe,"" as Jonas says many times there are other things this society lacks as well - things like love. And the way that The Giver explores these topics and all of the details is fascinating. I just wanted to know more! 
 The only reason why I wouldn't give this book a full 5 star rating is because I didn't love the ending. Not necessarily what actually happened, but the pace of things. There was a lot of time spent on world building for the first 3/4 of the book, but then all of the plot happened at once, and quickly, and I wanted so much more from it. 
 I also listened to this book on audio and wasn't crazy about the narration. I felt like Jonas came off as really whiny, and I wasn't sure if he was that way if you were just reading the book or if that was a result of the narrator's interpretation.",4,0.424,0.554,0.999

 this book is so cute! 
 it is all about a little boy who cannot function without his stuffed monkey, bobo. i can totally relate - if i have to sleep without my bunny, i become very unhappy. i no longer carry him everywhere with me, as i did my entire freshman year of college (job interviews were fun, let me tell you!) earning me the nickname ""bunny girl,"" but i still have him and love him, and if my cat were to keep stealing him on me, like the cat in this book, there would be problems. oh - who am i kidding - i would think it was adorable. the boy in this book seems to have a problem with sharing bobo with his cat, earl, but i think i would be okay with it. maggie does not seem to like to snuggle with toys as much as i do. she is way more mature than her owner. 
 i love how bobo seems to make this kid bratty, ""BOBO DOESN'T LIKE RAISINS IN HIS OATMEAL!!"" ""BOBO THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING PANCAKES"", but bobo also protects him from scary dogs and buggas. and that is an admirable quality in stuffed pals. 
 the illustrations are very simple, but i love the frowny expression on earl's face whenever willy takes bobo back. earl will have his vengeance. adorable.

145,"This is a review of both Bradford Street Buddies: Block Party Surprise and Bradford Street Buddies: Backyard Camp-OutBackyard Camp-Out. 
 These new easy readers published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt star a diverse cast of neighbors: Jada and Jamal Perkins, who are twins, and their friends Carlita Garcia and Josh Cornell. Together, the Bradford Street Buddies have everyday childhood experiences and solve problems around their block. 
 In Block Party Surprise, the kids help Mr. Perkins solve the problem of how to transport a special surprise from his house to the block party. In Backyard Camp-Out, the kids plan to sleep outside in a tent, but they are spooked by a noise in the bushes. These books are not much different from series like Iris and Walter and Henry and Mudge, but the appealing illustrations cause them to stand out as compared with another new series, Confetti Kids, which is similar in content, but not as strongly written or illustrated. Since there are few multicultural easy readers out there, most libraries will probably want to purchase these. They will also please kids who like stories about everyday people doing everyday things in familiar places.",4,0.267,0.143,0.95

I realize that I am not in the target age group for this book, but even as a young child I don't think that the story would have been satisfying to me. While other characters are mentioned in passing, the only character who we see into the mind of at all is the bee, which makes it kind of hard to accept that he is a bully - sure, being stung by a bee isn't all that pleasant, but the only evidence we have that it bothers the creatures so stung are the reaction shots. There's no journeying into the thoughts of any of the other characters, which undercuts any impact the bee's sudden epiphany might have had. I think that it's laudable more books about bullying are coming out, but this isn't really a book about bullying. It's a book where the bully is momentarily thwarted in his bullying ways for no reason, suddenly has an epiphany that he's been doing it wrong, and then is magically cured of bullying, amen.

Many of the scenes from this book have stayed in my memory and helped me through some of the trickier events of our parenting. When you remember how much Ramona thought being able to pull every piece of tissue out of a tissue box would be a great gift for a family friend it helped you to be more patient with your own kids.

178,"This book may be aimed at children, but I believe the words and content are so powerful in their simplicity that even adults would do well to read this. That is not to say that Kate Milner is ""simplifying"" the refugee crisis in any way, shape or form. Not at all. On the contrary, I believe she has succeeded in shedding light at a situation that is absolutely horrific and nightmarish and giving us a glimpse at how parents with children deal with it. 
 No one wants to be in their shoes, and no one thinks they'll ever be put in that situation until they find themselves in it. How do you deal with it? Especially when you have kids? How do you balance the reality of the situation while still trying to protect and shield your children from any harm? 
 And those refugee children, who are so much more open to change and are capable of adapting to new environments more readily than adults and experience things differently, to see them through Milner's words, it's truly moving. 
 I especially loved the little side questions that allow you to interact and engage with your child while reading the book. Very clever, and very inspiring. 
 The book can be read in less than 5 minutes, but the emotional impact will stay with you and it will have you thinking and evaluating your life. It will make you hug your children a little tighter and count your blessings.",5,0.429,0.969,0.986

So everyone helped move it out of the street and into Stella's front yard. It stuck out a bit into the sidewalk and took up the entire yard. The next morning when Stella looked out her window, things had changed again. Now there were people sitting on their front wall, children wrestling in the grassy shade under the bus. The adults began cleaning things up. When some boys spray painted the side of the bus one night, they were invited back to paint one of Stella's designs instead. The bus had become a hub of activity for the entire community. But then one Saturday morning things changed again, when a tow truck arrived. What will happen next to the bus called heaven?

When Betty realizes he's right, she enlists her brother's help so she can learn to play for real. Will her hard work pay off? 
 While I'm not a fan of the ""everybody gets a trophy"" style of parenting, it was nice to see Betty Bunny working hard to get her goal and learning that failures frequently happen on the way to success. Betty comes across as a bit spoiled at times, but she does seem to grow and learn from this experience, and the twist in the end was amusing.

The story felt too long and there were parts that weren't necessary such as the chapters with the frogs. I also questioned why bats were initially presented as bad guys; in the real world bats do fantastic job of controlling the mosquito population. 
 I did like the mythic overtones to the story and Eliza's journey and the use of different animals as helpers on her journey. The subplot of a storm and it's effects on the animals and how they react to it was sweet and, if not subtle, was not a too obvious commentary on cooperation. There is a generous helping of quotes from childrens books that are in the public domain; Tara clearly loves and knows childrens books. She also has a talent for words and language that children and adults can enjoy: 
 The memory melted into the fog, and Eliza felt very tired. The question came again to her. It appeared out of the gray, out of the damp, out of the cold corners of this new house. The question whispered-it always did-the kind of whisper that sounded very loud indeed 
 Even butterflies knew what she knew-that stories are forever friends; they speak a language any girl or butterfly could understand. 
 Books give warmth. They warm us with their words. 
 ""These are huckleblerries,"" she said. ""Huckleblerries?"" asked Eliza. ""Yes. That's what they are called,"" declared the ladybug. ""Not huckleberries?"" asked Eliza. ""No!"" said the ladybug sharply. ""Huckleblerries, with an l. Ladybug starts with l. It's a very important letter."" 
 Gwooop went Eliza's foot as it sank into the mud. ""Walooop,"" said the mud as she pulled her foot back out. ""Gwooop!"" cried Eliza. ""Waloop!"" echoed the butterfly. 
 Tara weaves themes of the treasure found in stories, the delicate balance of life, and the importance of working together along with a subtler theme of ecology and preservation. Despite my love of books and my belief in the themes that Tara uses, the book, as I said earlier, just didn't hold my interest. Then again, I'm not the intended audience and maybe a child in elementary school or middle school might enjoy the book more.",2,0.88,0.528,0.994

252,"EVERY SINGLE SECOND by Tricia Springstubb is a realistic fiction story examining the struggles of middle grade friends in an urban neighborhood. 
 This story of friendship and families tells the story of Nella, Clem, and Angela who are friends that attend Catholic school together. A school closing, accidental shooting, and medical crisis cause stress in both the families and the local community. 
 Librarians will find the themes of racial tensions, PSTD, and school closings to be very timely. Youth who enjoy contemporary fiction will enjoy the authentic family and neighborhood situations. The coming-of-age approach will appeal to a broad spectrum of students. 
 The author's use of ""now"" and ""then"" chapters is an appealing literacy element, but requires readers to pay close attention to the narrative. The addition of the statue's perspective provides an additional point for discussion for those who choose a ""read-aloud"" approach.

263,"Review written for and published by Portland Book Review on February 27th: 
 Juliana's Bananas: Where Do Your Bananas Come From? is an educational children's book about the life cycle of the banana plant. Follow Juliana and her children Bertha and Billy who live on a small banana farm in the Windward Islands. The book goes through the typical lifecycle of the banana plant from planting to harvest, but also showcases some of the problems banana farmers may face: a hurricane that may ruin an entire crop, or diseases that can kill off individual plants. The book points out how important banana farming is to the community, and how important ethical farming (supporting small individual farms over company plantations) is to the local population. 
 Juliana's Bananas shines as an educational book, particularly as a tool to introduce children to different cultures. The end of the book also includes two banana-based recipes. The almond and banana smoothie and the banana fritter recipe will almost certainly require adult supervision to attempt. The illustrations are functional, but not anything special, the majority appearing to be Photoshop collage cut and paste of stock photos. However, the illustrations do get the point across. 
 While some readers may find Juliana's Bananas to be a bit of an obvious Fair trade advertisement, the book does a good job of introducing kids to where bananas come from, and what goes into getting them to their kitchen table.",3,0.4,0.31,-0.172

I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to reading the rest of this book because it isn't entirely my thing, but if it is your thing and you enjoy short stories or anthologies, I'd give this one a try.

 In ""The Seven Natural Wonders of the Earth"" its readers once again get to pretend they're on a plane piloted by Captain Frankie who this time will take them to view these spectacular wonders from the sky and learn something about them in the process. 
 Once again the book begins with showing the flags of the various places its readers will be taken to. Arriving at each of the planned destinations readers are given a poetic description of the place/site, followed by information about is being looked at. And to make sure everyone reading the book understands what they've been shown; Captain Frankie then asks questions about it. 
 I, as I've already said, found this book to have a twofold purpose; to turn on a child's imagination while at the same teaching them something in an enjoyable manner so their minds will remember it. For having done this so imaginatively, I'm giving Ms. Othitis 5 STARS.

275,"Something rare and amazingly special, one of those treasures that shines brightly on a number of fronts. This is, at its basic level, the story of Auggie's fifth grade year. The characters are outstanding. Main character August (Auggie), enters a school for the first time as a fifth grader because of his facial abnormalities, is drawn brilliantly, one of those rare characters of thought and feeling and goodness that meld into a believable jewel of a whole boy. His support is also exemplary. He was physically challenged at birth but he was also blessed with a loving, supportive, and realistic family, his parents and sister Olivia (Via), who not only see and treat him as a whole person, but come to be treasured by Auggie's and Via's friends, too. The kids at Auggie's school are spot-on, real kids who say and do real kid things, and some, unfortunately, who display less than kind responses to Auggie's appearance's oddity. The school's adults and Via's friends also are nicely written. 
 As an adult who has long worked with youngsters around Auggie's age, and having first-hand experience with unique appearance and with children with unique appearances, I came away from this not only having loved it myself, with the firm conviction that Wonder is a terrific story on its basic level, but more, a book of values underneath that youngsters will absorb to their benefit, values like the role of externals in seeing another person, the role of kindness, the roles of patience, authentic love and caring, and more than a bit of what goes around comes around.

281,"I am choosing to give this book 4 stars simply because I couldn't put it down. Overall though, I did not like it as much as the first book. I will not be recommending it to my nieces because of language and the behavior of the children in this book. Miri and Molly are now 6th graders in Middle School and buddies with their older brothers. The 4 of them keep each other out of trouble and then Miri and Molly accidentally get their brothers into trouble. I also didn't like the Civil War narrative, despite being a scholar of that time period. I felt like it was too stereotypical with the old guys doing reenactments as Confederate soldiers, the anti-Yankee sentiment expressed even among the people of today (Paxton the Glory of the Old Dominion) and OF COURSE the Confederates are big, bad men and the Yankees are the good guys. The moral and the author's note cleared up some of my misgivings though. The moral comes a little late in the book for my taste. The author's note does explain the real life incidents the story was based on. For those wishing to recommend this for a younger reader, there is a fair amount of violence used to show that war was brutal and not like a video game. 
 I liked practical Molly better than Miri. Molly is a quick thinker and has a better understanding of the past than Miri. Molly is a great actress and thinks fast. I felt bad for her that she felt like she may not belong in Miri's family and worried the magic would send her back. Miri is a bit dumb. She's a dreamer and a do-er but not a thinker. She rushes in without thinking about her actions. I felt annoyed with her for most of the book. 
 Ray and Robbie reminded me of the Weasley twins. They're always up to something, constantly in trouble and completely mischievous. They do have a softer, sweeter side. It drove me as crazy as the parents that they cut class and didn't know the first thing about history. Their 1864 story was really unbelievable given the way they talked and acted. Their age wasn't an issue, as the author points out in her note, but the rest bothered me. I did like that it was the girls who got them out of trouble!

 What happens next is unexpected, as a reviewer on the blog Vegbooks.org notes: 
 The great thing about this story is that Pa ends up seeing the deer differently on this hunting trip, and he finds he can no longer shoot them. His hunter's mentality shifts to one of compassion for the animals he is admiring. 
 After hearing why their father has come home empty-handed, his young daughters are happy that Pa chose not to kill the deer. The little girls announce that they prefer bread and butter anyway. 
 The Vegbooks review continues: 
 This is a good book for vegetarian parents wanting to teach their child about having compassion for animals, and it presents a positive image in regard to boys/men not participating in hunting. 
 I would second that. Pa is shown as a strong and wise man, and his attributes are not diminished by his choice not to kill.

293,"This book is tragic and heartbreaking, and it's another Polacco book that made me cry. I could actually see rating it anywhere from 1 to 5 stars; I had to think a bit before I assigned my number of stars rating. 
 It's as close to non-fiction as it can get; Polacco comes from a family of storytellers and the Say in the title is her great great grandfather. This story came down from Say, whose full name was Sheldon Russell Curtis. 
 This story takes place when he was in his mid teens and was a very reluctant Union soldier during the American Civil War. Pink is Pinkus Aylee, born a slave, also fighting for the Union and also a teenager. Pink saves Say when he finds him injured with a bullet hole in his leg. 
 These two develop a friendship and that is the uplifting part of the story. However, this is a grim story. It's about war and its horrors, and the brutality experienced by African Americans by the Confederacy. I'm now once again interested in the Andersonville POW camp. It's been years since I've read anything about it, and it's just briefly mentioned here. 
 These two are interesting characters. Pink knows how to read, even though it's illegal for a slave to be taught to read. Say has shaken the hand of President Lincoln. 
 I first shelved this as fiction and historical fiction but after reading it changed the shelves to biography, history, non-fiction. I'm not sure whether that's accurate labeling, but unless I see evidence to the contrary it works for me.

295,"Timminy is not looking forward to starting a new school, particularly one where his father is Assistant Principal. Now he won't be able to disguise from his parents how bullied he has been at school due to his small size. But his parents try to make the move more palatable by giving him a puppy, Maxi, who is a huge white furry ball of energy and love. Eventually, they discover that Maxi is deaf and have to figure out how to keep her safe in their woodsy new home. Meanwhile Timminy is busy worrying about school, dodging bullies who put him in lockers. When he meets his neighbor, Abby, she doesn't put up with his whining about his size. After all, she doesn't let her blindness slow her down at all. It is up to Timminy to realize that his size doesn't define him any more than Abby's or Maxi's disabilities do. It's time for them all to stand tall. 
 Plourde has created one of those dog books. You know, the ones where the dog dies. But at least she admits it right up front, warning readers that Maxi is one to be adored and loved but that she will be gone before the story is done. The book happily is about much more than that. It is about bullying and the ability to keep strong in the face of being different and unique. It is also about everyone being more than they seem on the surface, even those who may appear to be bullies at first. 
 The writing here is heartfelt and fast. Timminy is a great protagonist and though he can whine at times, it is always justified. The fact that he learns a lot from those around him is to his credit. He is also someone who offers second chances to others and seeks them himself when he does something wrong. This is a book about friendships and allowing people into your lives even if they are different in ways other than hearing and sight and size.

312,"This book captures the real-life story of wolves being reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. The focus of the story is one young female wolf who finds herself suddenly separated from her pack and alone in a new place. Her tracks are the only wolf tracks she sees, she is the only wolf she smells. Without a pack, she cannot hunt the way she is used to, so she survives mostly on mice. As she becomes an adult, she discovers another wolf, a male. The two of them become a mated pair and eventually have a family in Yellowstone. One lone wolf has created her own pack. 
 Markle's verse in the book really shines, illuminating the loneliness of this young wolf's new life, her troubles with hunting larger game, and her growth into an adult wolf. The poetry is filled with imagery that enlivens the book, making the cold and loneliness tangible to readers. 
 Marks' illustrations are equally successful. He captures the setting beautifully from the towering trees to the wide open spaces. In his illustrations, Yellowstone becomes just as real as the wolf herself, almost another character in the story. The vistas and close-ups he has created here give readers a very unique perspective on the life of this wolf. 
 Highly recommended, this book will work well for slightly older children because of the depth of the verse. It will work well in units about preservation and ecology. Appropriate for ages 6-8.",4,1,0.821,0.771
313,"What a ridiculously cute story! 
 While clearly meant for children, the book barely detracted from my enjoyment. Besides, it deals with some adult themes. 
 Long story short, the protagonist of the story is a wildly imaginative boy called Thomas, who's aboard a ship headed for the Caribbean where his father was posted as a governor. 
 Thomas has fantasies of becoming a dreaded pirate on the high seas and so, when pirates capture their ship, he hides in the ship to become a part of their crew. 
 He realizes the life of a pirate is not as glamorous as he thought, and through twists and turns, he gets back home. 
 The story is delightfully told, and is rib-tickling in tone.

318,"This was the third book in the Judy Moody series and the eighth book with Stink and Judy Moody in it that I have read. I love the characters. The writing is wonderful. The illustrations are amazing. Together Megan and Peter have created some wonderful books to be shared by the whole family. One of the greatest strengths of these books is that even though there are now 23 books between the Judy Moody books, the Stink Moody books and the two cross-over books, they can be read in almost any order. Some of the books make reference to events in earlier books but never to the extent that they need to be read in order. You can pick up any of the books and will have a great read in your hands. 
 In this book Mr. Todd has gone away to Italy for a teachers' convention. Judy does not get along with the new teacher and soon she is in need of tutoring in Math.

 This was a nice easy to read children's story. I think that it could have flowed a little better and the characters could have had more depth but other than that I really enjoyed it. 
 The story was exciting and is the kind that would be loved by children of all ages. I loved hoe Corrine was nice to animals (except scorpions) and she showed the same kindness to people. She wasn't scared of stories that every one told her, she was practical and a great main character to read about. 
 The setting wash lush and exotic, I want to dive right in. I think it's a great testament to the author when a reader wants to visit the setting and can imagine it clearly in their head. 
 It was good to see strong supportive adults who looked after the children even if they didn't help them in their adventure.

 On a personal level, I was surprised when rereading this to notice how many references there were to walking up and down the various stairways in the 30-floor building. It was a tiny--but insistent--reminder that this building is not accessible for people like me who need elevators to navigate different floors of buildings. I'm starting to have weird feelings about all these fantastic books (fantasy and particularly kids books with fantasy elements) that never feature people with mobility limitations, or any disabilities at all.

Mrs. Gray decides that her three sons are not going to go the way of her former three husbands, and the three mouse boys are courageous and strong. But I love that they're not just brawny mice. They're also clever and daring in the ways they try to get the cat out of the house, and they are also accepting of Kevin, the cellar-mouse. In short, they are very upstanding mice. King-Smith really hammers the acceptance concept pretty hard, also through the farmer's wife, who loves all the animals equally. This book reminds me of that story of belling the cat, or also the Rescuers. 
 I would think this would appeal mostly to the younger end of our spectrum - kids in the upper elementary grades. Both boys and girls should like this one. There's adventure and daring, sports, as well as a little romance and class conflict.

344,"The geese are flying south, the squirrels are busy and the crows are the only birds left in the trees. The air smells different and everyone knows that the trees must drop their leaves soon. Then the wind comes and the air fills with yellow leaves. Children run outside and play in the swirling yellow breezes. When the leaves have fallen, the yellow is in piles on the ground, covering everything. Children gather the leaves to press in books to remember the special time just before winter comes with its whiteness. 
 Stringer shares the drama of autumn in this picture book. She uses phrases like ""a symphony of yellow"" to capture the wonder of what is happening, mixing senses of sound and color together. When she describes the smell of autumn just before the leaves fall, she uses comparisons that children will understand: ""Like wet mud and dry grass with a sprinkle of sugar."" It offers up the richness and deepness of the smell, the intangible dryness that is part of it and the sweetness as well. She skillfully creates autumn on the page with her words. 
 The illustrations celebrate the diversity of a small neighborhood filled with yellow trees and the children who wait for the falling leaves to start. There is a gorgeous overload of yellow on the pages, bright and cheerful, filled with motion and tumbling breezes and leaves. The pages are just as fresh and vibrant as the season she is depicting.

 People don't ever change that fast. Kids are cruel. Kids don't find their moral as they could find their lost mp3 in their room. Nope. That doesn't happen.

358,"Blow Me A Kiss is an epically adorable picture book about a little boy named Samuel and the power of blowing someone a kiss. 
 Samuel is out grocery shopping with his mum, when he notices a number of adults in different shops looking not so happy for various reasons and decides to make it his mission to make them happy again. He does this in the most super cute way by blowing each person a massive kiss and watching it fly around the room until it smacks into their unsuspecting face. His kisses have their intended effects and Samuel continues on his way with a ear-to-ear smile plastered on his very own face. 
 I love this story on so many levels. Obviously it's a cute concept that is pulled off really well by both the author and illustrator. What's more not only does Samuel's magical kisses provide a fantastic message for children, it also shares an important one with adults as well - the need to step back from our chaotic lives and stop taking the small things in life, like a kiss blown by a small child or a simple smile from a stranger, for granted. The simple act of kindness message is so powerful, and yet understated in this book, that you never feel like you are being preached at. Rather it's just a natural story about a happy little boy who wants to make other's as happy as himself. 
 In terms of presentation, this book hits all the right spots. Karen Collum's text is simple, but effective and typeset in a similar font to Lucinda/handwritten style that brings this everyday and familiar feel to the narrative. Meanwhile Serena Geddes uses this simple and clever cartoonist style of illustration, where she utilises the white space on the page in unique and kid-friendly ways. I love the way the pair have created this kind of adventure feeling with each kiss that Samuel blows to his unsuspecting victims. Karen's text creates this journey whereby a kiss can transcends the limits of your lips and mouth by 
 .. fl[ying] under the chair, 
 behind the poster, 
 over the counter, 
 between the tellers, and landed on his nose with a loud 'SPLAT!' 
 The old man yelped and felt his face. 
 But it's Serena's illustrations and her 'heart' trail that weaves in and out and across the pages that really brings the whole adventure aspect and kiss to life. The visual aspect of this heart trail means small children can not only listen to the adventure the kiss takes to get to it's destination (in this case, the man's cheek) as their parent reads aloud, but they can also visually see and trace the kisses' path with their hands should they be so inclined, giving the story an added dimensional layer and depth to the story. 
 Blow Me A Kiss is a super sweet, but easy to relate to picture book that is ideal for young readers and anyone who is just looking for a beautiful story that will make you smile. I highly recommend this one for any parent looking for a unique and simply story to add to their child's library collection.

The dealer tells him it's only worth $120.00 because it was printed in a mass quantities. The boy believes the dealer and sells him the card only to find out later that the card is worth up to 1 million dollars. The boy is so angry by the ""swindle"" that he plans an elaborate plan almost as complicated as the one in the movie ""Ocean's Eleven"" to take back what is rightfully his.

The rhyming text moves the book along and creates interest in the subject, but there were some issues with pacing.

It then goes off on a tangent to describe the textures and types of poop different animals produce before it gets back on track and lays out an interesting fact per page (uses for poop etc).

382,"Anna is having trouble adjusting to middle school, and hanging out with her best friend Dorey doesn't help. Dorey doesn't care about being popular or about what she wears, and Anna is embarrassed to be around her. When the glamorous Jessamyn gives Anna a note to meet in a rarely used girls' bathroom, Anna is excited to be included in Jessamyn's secret group. When she agrees to take part in their initiations and ""calls on the spirits"" in the bathroom mirror, however, she faints. Jessamyn and her friends think that Anna is dopey, but it isn't long before Anna meets Emma, who is dangerous and cool. The two eat lunch on the roof of the school, throw balloons filled with catsup at Jessamyn, and even go off campus. Emma is a bit of a mystery, though-- she doesn't answer her phone, and is elusive about details of her life. She is also very jealous, and when Anna talks to Dorey and her new lab partner, Benny, bad things happen to them. Eventually, Anna is blamed for things that Emma is doing and starts to wonder: is Emma really her imaginary friend from childhood, and has she always been this evil? 
 Strengths: Anna's angst about being seen with Dorey is so true to life, and this is a pleasantly creepy tale. The 6th grade girls at my school adore all of the Scholastic Apple series: Candy, Poison AND Rotten! 
 Weaknesses: Not enough attention is given to why or how Emma has managed to manifest herself. I always appreciate a little bit of an explanation.",3,0.5,0.278,-0.675

There were two storylines running through this book, Stacey's journey with diabetes and the recently started Baby-Sitter's Agency with older baby-sitters taking the girls' business. I think showing Stacey handling her illness and really learning to be an advocate for herself and her health and how it has impacted her friendships is really get. It also gave her an opportunity to reconcile with a past friend which I appreciate the example of forgiveness. I also loved the girls tenacity in the face of competition. They knew that the lure of older kids who could baby-sit later would be desired by the other parents. They couldn't change those things about their club, but their Kid-Kits were a brilliant idea. And, they are great examples of responsibility and what it looks like to be a baby-sitter.

 The writing was well done, but I didn't like the concept of the story. The subtitle is ""A Story of True Friendship"", but Bear is miserable throughout the majority of the book. She employs various ways of hiding from Bug, and constantly tells him to go away and leave her alone. She is quite mean to him, while he is upbeat, cheerful, and just wants to play. 
 I guess the thing I had a problem with was how thoughtless Bear was. A true friend wouldn't be so rude. If it had been passed off as a story of forgiveness, or a story of learning kindness, I think I could have liked it. Bear could have been much more likable, and the same story could have played out in a more positive way.

 In order to encourage my kids to read this summer I promised to put their reviews in my blog. Hopefully you'll like them and tolerate the proud mama syndrome. So *roll drums here* this is B's first review: 
 This is one of the best books I ever read! It is a combination of case files put together by Tommy to decide if he should ask Origami Yoda an important question. It keeps you wondering if he is magical or not. 
 My favorite character is Tommy because he likes Sara very much and wants to know if she likes him. I wish there was an Oragami Yoda at my school so I could ask him stuff (I am going to sixth grade in August.) The more annoying character was Harvey because he didn't believe in Yoda at all and try to make one of his own. Dwight is just weird, but he doesn't know that he is. 
 I think that Dwight had a good plan from the beginning and it all works out at the end. I would recommend this book to other fifth graders like me. I'll read book two when it comes out.

 So, I picked this up because the idea of a ""green bomb"" was interesting to me. However, I really can't see any possible scientific reason for it's affects, or why breathing in paired oxygen would be instantly fatal;I can see it not, you know, providing oxygen, however killing you instantly? I doubt it. And I also have issues with the affects on metal, how? Why? The bombs breath isn't fatal outside a very thin layer of the atmosphere; why does it affect every single magnet and bit of metal on the planet? I can see it causing problems for surface metals in the range of the blasts, but what about new minerals? The bombs didn't kill people in bunkers, there's no reason for it to affect metal at the same levels of the earth. More importantly, if iron is suddenly far, far weaker...what affect would that have on the planets core, which we believe to be composed primarily of molten iron and nickle? 
 Still. It's YA science fiction. In that genre, the plot device is...amazingly refreshing in that I haven't seen it many many times over. The protagonist is believable and likeable.

 This book is just a jewel! At the beginning of the book, little CJ complains to his grandmother about everything - waiting for the bus in the rain, not having a car, and having to go to the soup kitchen every Sunday after church. For every complaint he has, his grandmother points out the bright side. On the bus, he meets several interesting people, including a blind man and a musician. As he and his grandmother get off the bus, CJ asks her why everything in the neighborhood by the soup kitchen is so dirty. It's at this point that the grandmother says, ""Sometimes when you're surrounded by dirt, CJ, you're a better witness for what's beautiful."" 
 I loved this book! The grandmother's kind, grateful attitude just resonated throughout. Truthfully, this book almost made me cry. I thought CJ and his grandmother were going to the soup kitchen to eat because they were poor. No - they were going to the soup kitchen to work, dishing out food to the less fortunate. 
 This would be a great read-aloud for 1st grade through even 6th or 7th grade.

They are able to avert disaster while using their extraordinary talents. 
 Nicholas Benedict, whom they work for, suffers from narcolepsy as does the headmaster of the school they have infiltrtated. Both are apt to nod off in times of excitement, strong emotion, and danger. I did a little reading on the disease and the book is quite accurate on it's effects.

Each book has three short stories in it. In this first volume, the first story revolves around a planned picnic that goes wrong when rain clouds move in; the second story involves Big Duck trying desperately to remember something while Little Duck does his best to remind her what it is she's forgotten; and story three involves a camping trip that Big Duck makes way to complicated.",5,1.167,0.601,0.987

 This book by Vera Southgate is my whole childhood. It went everywhere with me when I discovered it in my library and then purchased my own copy with my pocket money when I was 10. 
 A more in-depth and traditional version of the Cinderella tale, the illustrations by Eric Winter are simply breathtaking! Cinderella goes to the ball three times, and each gown is stunning (my favorite was always dress #2 with dress #3 coming in a close 2nd - dress #1 is beautiful too). 
 This book was the one I always read to my dolls and teddy's at tea-time and bed-time and I jealously guarded it from my younger sibling's sticky fingers. This book indirectly inspired me I suppose to design gowns and evening dresses - an artistic career I have enjoyed for many years.

I love the idea of the Three Pearls and the characters of Prince Inga, Zella, Nikobob, King Rinkitink, and Bilbil the goat, as well as the depiction of Kaliko as the Nome King. There's actually some real dramatic tension during Prince Inga's multiple attempts to rescue his parents and their people from Regos and Coregos and especially when Prince Inga and Rinkitink are separated and challenged by the Nome King's magic! 
 I'm less enamored of Dorothy and the Wizard as the deus ex machina that swoop in at the end to make everything right with a basket of eggs and a well-placed foot-stamp or two, and the obligatory banquet in the second to last chapter where every personage of any standing in Oz makes an appearance. 
 The title is a bit disingenuous since Oz doesn't even come up until chapter 20 of 24, and I'm not sure why Rinkitink gets top billing over Prince Inga. But Oz was what was selling, so I'm sure that's why Mr. Baum threw them in at the end and Rinkitink is just a lot of fun to say!

446,"A witch has been haunting 12-year-old Charlie Laird's dreams for the past three weeks. He's terrified every night and has resorted to sneaking his parents coffee to stay awake. His mom has died and dad remarried. Charlie is convinced his stepmonster is the witch tormenting him each night. His anger and fears make him belligerent to others and mean to his younger brother. The ghost story is not too frightening but creepy enough to be fun. The pacing is well done and the tension unfolds as clues are slowly doled out to pull the reader along. Charlie goes from tired and out-of-it to downright cranky and rude. Just when I was getting tired of his attitude he gets swept into the alternate world of his nightmares where he saves others, lightens up, and learns to face his fears. 
 Charlie is so exhausted, I wanted to crawl under my desk and go to sleep. Night-after-night he is tormented by a witch that comes to him in his sleep. He tries to deal with the witch on his own but when she visits him when he isn't sleeping he gets really frightened. This isn't a nightmare anymore but reality. He decides to include his best friends, Paige, Rocco, and Alfie, on what is happening to him each night. Charlie has two deep-seated fears that are so crippling that he has opened a portal allowing the nightmare creatures a chance to enter the real world. The main villain is trying to change Neverworld, the alternate nightmare world, by causing Charlie to be permanently afraid to keep the portal open and take over the real world. Charlie tries to stop the villain and shows that not only does he care about others, he is willing to risk his life to save them. 
 The characters are really respectful of Charlie not laughing at his fears. I end up dealing everyday with students who have hurt others feelings because they laugh at them in mean-spirited ways. I appreciated the group not laughing at Alfie's doofiness or Charlie's fears. As Paige says, ""Only weak people need to make others small."" Mean-spirited teasing is where it begins so often in the classroom. The characters model for readers how to deal with these every day occurrences that happen in school or with siblings. That's not to say the characters don't have flaws. They do and they learn from them. But the subtle message of not laughing at others to be mean, is not didactic, and is a good discussion point. 
 The nightmares that exist in Neverworld are a nod toward Peter Pan's Neverland a metaphor for a never-ending childhood. Neverworld is a metaphor for never-ending fears. The characters must learn to face their fears and deal with them otherwise they will turn bitter and lonely. Fear makes it impossible to live a full life and its a universal theme for adults as well as children. It takes courage to root out what is frightening and face it. While this is the main theme there are others that add depth to the story. Additional points for discussion include grief, friendship, courage, and bullies to name a few. 
 This book reminds me of ""Nightmare Acadamy: Charlie's monsters"" by Dean Lorey (UK title) or ""Monster Hunters"" (US title). That story has children who have nightmares and the monsters come to life. They have to go to an academy to learn to control them. It is loaded with more action than themes. This book has more to discuss than the other, they are both are fun reads.",4,-0.243,-0.877,-0.993

481,"*Originally posted on ashleighreads.com * 
 I am on a roll this week, because I read not only one, but two books! This definitely makes me worthy of the biggest gold star ever. Though, to be fair, the second book I read was a children's book--The Little Prince, by Antoine de Saint Exupery. 
 This book is considered a children's classic but, for one reason or another, I myself never picked it up as a kid (I was probably too busy reading Junie B. Jones or Harry Potter or something Beverly Cleary). It came to me from a friend who, upon hearing I had never read it, brought me his own copy to read, the book so old that the pages are yellowing and soft from being turned over and over. Already the pressure is on, since sharing books is, in my opinion, a highly intimate and personal experience; it's like someone is sharing a part of themselves with you, and you want to fully appreciate and honor their trust in letting you glimpse into their life. Knowing the book was fairly short and had plenty of pictures woven in with its chapters, I started almost immediately. 
 The story-within-a-story tells the tale of a pilot stranded in the desert who encounters the little prince, a boy who has fallen from an asteroid. The bulk of the book is the little prince recounting his experiences traveling through space and on Earth, as he comes along several allegorical characters (such as a king, a businessman, a conceited man...etc.). Each encounter is seen through childlike bewilderment at the absurdity of adulthood, and the paradoxes the little prince sees between what these adults say and do. He also befriends a fox, who teaches him what it means to be tamed (""to establish ties"") and how we establish these ties to even the most ordinary, common things. Other allegorical elements are the little prince's planet, which he is the sole habitant, as well as a rose that drifts to his planet, which he comes to find great affection for after taking care of her. 
 Though the story is, technically, a children's book, it was surprisingly relevant to me as an adult (or however much being a 21-year old constitutes being an adult). It was whimsical and touching, and made me think about the person who I wanted to be as a child and who I've actually grown up to be. I was especially fond of the encounters with the fox and the rose, as they spoke more to me about what it is to have people come and go from your life, and how best to love them. 
 And, of course, I discovered by the first page that this was the book with the famous ""boa constrictor eating an elephant"" drawing, which became the narrator's test to see whether or not someone had succumbed to adulthood. 
 Overall, I'm glad this book made its way into my hands; it was a charming reminder to take a step back and look at what is most important in living one's life. It felt like it came at just the right time...funny, how books find a way of doing that. And though I didn't get to read it as a child, I'm sure it will stick with me as an adult.",3,1.905,1.478,0.998
482,"Part of Scholastic's I Am series, Cleopatra was published January 2014. Aimed at readers ages 8-10, this is an excellent historical reference in a biographical/autobiographical hybrid format. It's a light, yet in-depth look at Cleopatra's life, politics, and legend. 
 Filled with illustrations and divided into concise chapters, Cleopatra is a well-written and beautifully illustrated book. Readers will learn of Cleopatra's early years, her rise to becoming pharaoh, her family, her romantic relationships with Caesar and Antony, her children, politics, and her demise. Told in a narrative format, the text is accessible and meets the needs of the target audience. (Short attention spans and reluctant readers of educational texts won't find this book difficult!) Each chapter is only a few pages long, and includes sub-headings to further break up the text. The illustrations are a cross between sketches and cartoon-like drawings, which will deter readers from considering the book to be a dry, history lesson in disguise. 
 The book includes side notes, terms, and timelines which introduces relevant subjects such as hieroglyphics and understanding BCE and CE. It also provides the reader with photographs of art and of important geographical locations. Cleopatra is perfect for beginner readers who need to gain an understanding of Cleopatra and of her connections to the Roman empire for both educational and personal interest purposes. 
 Furthermore, the book is an excellent companion for readers who enjoy Rick Riordan's books. The writing style is comparable and the information is relevant to expanding on the content Riordan writes about, particularly in The Kane Chronicles.

 In the third volume of the series, A Bad Spell for The Worst Witch, Mildred Hubble does not only - miraculously - begin her second year at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, she also manages to tick off Ethel again. Ethel's revenge leaves much to be desired if you ask Mildred, but it also earns her a new ally - Algernon Rowan-Webb, a very old magician. 
 In the fourth volume, The Worst Witch All At Sea, Mildred and the rest of her form - plus Miss Hardbroom and Miss Cackle - are invited spend a weeklong holiday at sea, but there's no such thing as slacking off where Miss Hardbroom is concerned. It doesn't help that Mildred's new cat just isn't as cuddly as Tabby, and Mildred gets into plenty of shenanigans even on her best behaviour. 
 Oh Mildred, if only you knew how much I loved you. You might just feel better about yourself. 
 I still adore her and all the shenanigans she gets into. She's such a fierce and loving girl, it's a shame that everything always goes to pot, no matter how much she applies herself. I do sometimes wish there were more to her stories than her continued bad luck and awfulness at everything she lays her hands on, but then these are books for young children and their theme is that she is the absolutely worst witch. There'd be no point if she wasn't. 
 Still though, sometimes it might be nice to see her form teacher or even the headmistress actually try and help her instead of just chiding and being upset and, dare I say it, seemingly hateful of her. It paints an unfortunate picture of the adults in a child's life and it's no wonder that Mildred not only suffers from bad luck but also bad judgement when there is nobody to guide her. I'm actually a bit disappointed that there hasn't been more to Miss Hardbroom; we were given a glance of humanity in her at the end of the first book, but there is nothing remotely like that in the other three so far. 
 The shenanigans themselves are nonetheless lovely to read and I'd be lying if I denied that they make me smile. Mildred shows a very kind heart to those that show her the same respect and, though begrudgingly, also those who seem to despise her and for that I adore her.",4,-0.024,-0.201,-0.913
505,"Heart and laughs - great for discussions and to get reluctant readers reading! 
 This is one of my favourite Walliams' books, a rather sad story about a father and son missing their mum/wife, living hand to mouth and with handmade birthday gifts, trying to find happiness through wealth, but finding in the end it's their love for each other that's the most important thing. 
 And of course, it's also hilarious - Mr Spud invents a wildly popular new loo roll (Bum Fresh - wet on one side, dry on the other) and he and his son Joe can light PS50 notes on fire, they are that rich. Yet Joe isn't happy - he has everything except the one thing he wants... a friend. Insisting he enrol at a regular comprehensive school as just another schoolboy, he is going to discover just what friendship should be, the power of money, and what's important to him. 
 It is also, of course, a very funny story, with a surreally disgusting school cook and her 'bat sick' menu, school bullies that nobody can tell apart (despite one being a girl and one a boy), and lots of wonderful lists. 
 Walliams and Lucas have a ball with the voices in this audio adaptation (unabridged). It's a fantastic story to share with a child - in a classroom or bedroom, talking about buying friendship with money, bullying, love, parents, wanting to be rich - so much to discuss. 
 Now we've read this, my son is keen to watch the BBC adaptation as well, which we will be doing. Just love the idea of this and Walliams' execution of it.",5,1.444,1.142,0.997

 Perkenalkan Robert, seorang anak berumur 12 tahun yang sangat membenci matematika dan terutama guru matematikanya. Baginya angka-angka dan segala macam hitung-hitungan adalah hal yang menjemukan. Tapi, pandangannya tersebut perlahan-lahan berubah sejak bertemu Setan Angka dalam mimpinya. Dari malam ke malam Setan Angka mengajaknya bertualang menjelajahi dunia matematika. Segala macam keunikan dan keajaiban matematika pun ditemui Robert. Dan di akhir perjumpaannya dengan Setan Angka, Robert pun menyadari bahwa sebenarnya matematika itu asyik! 
 Setelah menyelesaikan buku ini saya simpulkan hanya ada dua keistimewaan buku ini, yaitu kovernya yang keren dan berbagai keunikan dan kejaiban matematis yang mungkin tidak kita perhatikan atau ketahui. Contohnya bagaimana semua angka yang kita kenal selama ini (kecuali angka nol) pada dasarnya berasal dari angka 1, keistimewaan-keistimewaan angka nol, beberapa fakta yang mungkin tidak kita ketahui tentang The Golden Ratio-nya bilangan Fibonacci, dan masih banyak lagi keunikan dan keajaiban matematika yang dapat kita temukan di buku ini. Oh, ya. Untuk soal kover buku ini harus saya akui memang keren! Simpel dan benar-benar tepat sasaran sesuai judul bukunya. Kover ini juga lah salah satu faktor yang membuat saya memutuskan membeli buku ini. 
 Selain dua hal di atas tidak ada yang istimewa lagi dari buku ini. Semuanya biasa-biasa saja, bahkan menurut saya sedikit kekanak-kanakan. Tapi ya wajar juga sih. Soalnya oleh penerbitnya buku ini dikategorikan ke dalam fiksi anak. Dan anehnya meski dikategorikan ke dalam fiksi anak, justru menurut saya buku ini tidak begitu cocok dibaca oleh anak-anak. Kenapa? Pertama, Setan Angka dalam buku ini digambarkan sebagai tokoh yang keras dan galak. Kedua, Setan Angka juga ini sering mengumpat-umpat jika Robert agak lamban berpikir atau tidak bisa mengerjakan beberapa soal. Umpatannya pun cukup keras, seperti ""Dasar otak udang!"". Bahkan Robert pun pernah disebutnya ""kroco"". Entah ini penerjemahannya yang tidak beres atau dari bahasa asli penulisnya memang seperti itu, menurut saya buku ini tidak cocok dibaca anak-anak. Menurut saya lebih pantas jika dibaca oleh orang tua untuk kemudian diajarkan kepada anak-anak. Padahal buku ini juga dilengkapi ilustrasi-ilustrasi yang menarik untuk anak-anak. Sayang sekali jika buku ini tidak bisa dibaca oleh anak-anak karena bahasa yang terlalu vulgar tadi. 
 Well, seperti yang saya sebut tadi buku ini memang sedikit kekanak-kanakan. Seperti membaca buku dongeng untuk anak-anak saja. Tapi, cukup banyak ilmu dan wawasan baru tentang matematika yang saya peroleh dari buku ini. Apalagi kover buku ini menurut saya sangat bagus untuk dikoleksi. Yah, tiga bintang masih layak lah untuk buku ini.",3,0,0,0.454
520,"Wilbur is the runt of his litter, and usually being a runt means dying as an infant. But kind farm girl Fern begs her father to let her raise the piglet, and raise him she does--with a bottle and some tender loving care. Soon it's hard to tell he was ever a runt, but on Fern's farm, pigs usually eventually become supper, and Fern loves Wilbur as a pet. When Wilbur finds out what fate has in store for him, he panics, but soon the whole barnyard rallies behind him to help the world see that he's something special. With the help of the literate rat Templeton and the artistic and charming spider Charlotte, web-woven messages about Wilbur's specialness begin to pop up over his pen, and now of course there's no way Fern's family can eat him. Can Wilbur show his gratitude to Charlotte for saving his life? 
 Usually a book of this sort would not appeal to me because I never liked books about sentient talking animals or books wherein a sentient creature attempts to avoid being eaten--and this is especially difficult to swallow because despite their apparent intelligent, people still eat animals in this world. Children who read this book probably have families that serve them the flesh of the same animals who are their favorite characters in this book, and that definitely weirds me out. (I still wonder whether this book had any hand in my becoming a vegetarian once I moved out of my parents' house.) However, the interplay of the animals, their friendship, Wilbur's will to live, and the characters' experience of simple pleasures is so heartwarming and enjoyable to read, so I recommend it despite the cognitive dissonance it might cause for some children. Parents, though: Don't be surprised if your kids want to be vegetarian for a while after reading this. The eating of animals is almost portrayed as cruel in this book considering Wilbur can think, feel, and contemplate his own end.",4,0.778,0.611,0.994

Little do they know that the island is magical and that its inhabitants are under a curse. Kat must overcome her fear and save the island from a villianous creature before it is too late. 
 The Secret of the Water Knight is a book with a lot of imagination. It is an enjoyable read until the end. Kat finds herself in the villian's underwater cave, breathing through a long tube that a couple of seagulls are holding above the water. She actually has a conversation with the villian while underwater. While this is a work of fiction, attention should still be made to ensure the actions are believable. The reader might also be left feeling like there should be more to the story - like what's the history of the dolphin known as the Water Knight? How did the villian get its power? Why is the island magical? More character development would have improved the story.

But Tanner is so confident and competent that Ryan goes along with him. 
 The beginning of the trip was easier than Ryan thought it would be. The river was high, and easy to navigate; the sunshine and the fishing were great. Ryan almost began to enjoy himself. The first whitewater chute was exciting and a little scary, but the second chute was bigger, louder, and more dangerous. Just as they started down, Ryan saw something ahead: a black log, right in the middle of the chute, with a jagged end pointing straight at them, and it wasn't moving. Not at all. 
 When their rubber kayak was impaled by the log, the boys were thrown out into the river. Ryan swam for shore, but Tanner floated downriver, unconscious.

 I have been wanting to read this since I picked it up at BEA (2015) I adored this book and Pip is quite the character. She is so cute and she can talk to magical creatures. This book has a lot of great humor and awesome writing style. I loved the descriptions of each magical creature and the illustrations were fantastic they add so much more to the story. Even though the Fuzzles were a bit of a problem I thought they were so cute, and it would be best not to own one as a pet since they do cause a bit of trouble like start fires. A lot of the creatures in the book were so well thought out and I loved that Pip was doing her own research and adding to her Guide. 
 The story was fun and the world build was fantastic. I really think Maggie and Jackson need to write more books together I am hoping this book is a part of a long series, I would love to spend more time in Pips world. This books is great for middle grade kids but enjoyable to adults. I can't wait for my daughter to start reading, this will be the first one I give to her to enjoy. I highly recommend for a fun, cute and quirky story with some pretty cool illustrations.

550,"The Key to the Treasure by Peggy Parish was one of those childhood books that I greatly enjoyed, and beyond belief, my parents still had floating around. Published in 1966, with a bright yellow cover, the story is that of three nice white children who have a nice white adventure at their grandparent's house. In the past, their white ancestor went off to fight in the civil war, but he left behind clues for his children to follow. Alas, the children never got the proper clues. With a little luck and a little pluck, it falls to these three kids to discover and decode those clues. 
 To be honest, as I read this book, which sometimes flowed easily and other times sounded stilted, I found that excitement in my belly and knew why I came to this book again and again. The books picks up an energy by the middle. I once again wanted to reach the end and see how everything turned out.

552,"I remember all five of my children learning to say and identify their letters and learning to write them. I'd sit down with them and speak of little things that might help make it fun for them such as the ""M has two peaks pointing up like the tops of two mountains."" Well, Linda Jones has taken the joyful task of teaching children the letters by creatively giving personality, shape, rhyme, and meaning to each letter. 
 With each letter, it takes on a personality which is brought out in the rhyme and in the identifying words such as snake, sleek, slinky for the letter ""S."" As the child is being read this rhyme, he can repeat all these ""S"" words with emphasis on the s-s-s-s sound. This helps him to develop listening and thinking skills because he hears the sound, repeats the sound, and thinks about the context of the rhyme and the picture on the page. 
 Look at the ""T"" page and the ""T"" words that go along with it. ""T"" stands tall, too. We want our capital ""T"" to go all the way to the top of the space between the lines so he stands tall. 
 T stands tall hauling timber on top of his head. 
 He's building a tree house and painting it red. 
 T - Timber 
 I really love the ""B"" page. When introducing ""B"" we get a little lesson in the letter itself, and the words that begin with ""B""; but most fun of all, we get to see where ""B"" gets his belly. Its a bit of a ""health"" lesson tossed in for good measure. 
 Linda Jones is the mother of 4 sons and her son Branson is the illustrator of her book. Jones has a passion for helping children learn their letters, learn to read, and become life-long learners.

572,"From the delightful and crazy genius of Shel Silverstein comes this wacky collection of poems and drawings. I doubt there has ever been or ever will be another poet that can move audiences the way that he can. 
 Call me crazy, but I was not expecting this book to be so funny. Weird, yes. But funny? You should know that I laughed the whole way through. So did my kids. 
 Silverstein's writing is impeccable. His lines flow off the tongue with ease and captivate children and grown ups alike. Often, rhyming books and poetry lack an ease of reading out loud. But the poems in Everything On It rhyme perfectly and flow smoothly, making them easy and fun to read. 
 Just like his writing, Silverstein's black and white drawings are entertaining and engaging. Often, the picture works with the writing to tell the entire story. His style is easily loved by children. I think that this is because his artwork looks a lot like something a child would draw. They relate to art that looks like it belongs in their world. 
 Silverstein is a kid that never really grew up. His poems encompass a wide range of crazy subjects including oddly shaped heads, cheating in school, strange salesmen, and obscure shops. The one subject I noticed pop up more than any other was cannibalism. If that is a subject that bothers you, then you probably shouldn't read it. There are monsters, man eating plants, child eating horses, and people eating giants to be found in the pages of this book. If you enjoy the wacky and the weird and are ready to find a book full of laughs, then this is the one for you.

 I knew all the information this book presented about Julia Child already, but that didn't make it any less delightful. The authors thankfully did not dumb down her story at all, and I imagine that any child reading this would find dozens of things to inspire them. ?The illustrations are sweet and inviting, and this would be a great way to convince kids to learn to cook or try new foods.

579,"Daksha, the Medicine Girl, is about a 12 year old adolescent girl. This story introduces the reader to cultural and traditional village mountain life experience explained through historical research, training as an ayurvedic specialist, loss and emotional withdrawal and isolation, and the development of trust and friendships. The background of the story takes place in the Himalayan Mountains in the Village of Parbat Devi. The author introduces new vocabulary and provides explicit definitions for each new word; the narration of the story is by an objective narrator, who observed and has both a relationship with the development and experience with the characters and the story itself. This is an innovative cultural story about Daksha who becomes an ayurvedic specialist by apprenticeship with her vaidya, an ayurvedic doctor, Panditji. Ayurveda is a traditional herbal form of medicine practiced by the Hindu of India; knowledge is passed orally generation to generation. The apprentice memorizes all information that is taught without writing it down. Although Daksha suffered the loss of both parents and brother from flash floods, she was not an orphan; she was adopted by the village community. Although primarily cared for by Panditji, Daksha developed independent skills toward becoming an active member of the working community as a village healer. Due to a twist of fate, Daksha is given an opportunity to attend school at the local Army Base near her village; this educational opportunity offers a tangible learning experience and an alternative future to hone and develop her interests and scientific inquiries into anatomy and physiology. I enjoyed reading this book. The use of simple language provides illicit cognitive inquiry about Daksha's own interests and curiosities as well as her isolation, emotions, cognitive and physical development in the moment and over time. I recommend this book for readers in Grades 4 - 6. 
 As a reader, I feel I missed out on Daksha's experiential learning and personal growth. I feel the story stopped short of describing her experience and growth from being exposed to new environments and people; I was disappointed the story is only 18 pages in length. I would like to have read about the relationship between Daksha and Dr. Hemalatha developed and grew into both a personal and professional relationship.",5,0.167,0.722,0.955

588,"I always wonder how well a piece of realistic fiction will resonate with kids. This one is obviously targeted at a specific problem, the one of not being believed, and being misunderstood. The voice is uncomplicated, and uses some sophisticated vocabulary for the age group--which I think is great. We want kids to know that their thinking has real words. This is targeted at preschool, so it is most likely intended as a read-aloud. But it may be a good chapter book for K-1, too. 
 The writing did not seem condescending, which is what I look for as the common mistake when a writer is trying to inhabit the mind of a child. 
 I think this could be a good story for complicating bullying, because the main character does not realize that her own actions may be what is causing the little brother to want to blame Sadie & Ratz for everything that goes wrong. She is the bully, and while things do work out for the best, I don't know that the book is about her 'learning her lesson.' 
 This book makes me think about Bruno Bettelheim's work, and the idea that specific issues and conflicts may be better explored in fiction, especially with folk and fairy tale material--because we can exaggerate and amplify and even make characters out of the issue. I'm often suspicious of issues-based realistic fiction for this reason. For this one, because the writing did not feel didactic or condescending I felt okay giving it a 3.",3,-0.111,-0.16,-0.401

Author Jack Cheng says that he loves writing dialogue, so choosing to write the story in this way allowed him to write almost entirely in dialogue. Protagonist Alex is an eleven-year-old (but at least thirteen in responsibility years), who travels to a large rocket festival with hopes to launch a rocket into space carrying a golden iPod (to imitate his hero Carl Sagan's Golden Record). Along the way he meets lots of online friends, makes new friends, and even finds some unexpected things about his own family. 
 Alex is a very self-sufficient tween. He does the shopping and cooking for himself and his mom, figures out how to travel to the rocket festival, and has even found a small job at a local gas station. Despite all the responsibility of caring for his mom, he hasn't lost his faith in the universe and wants to follow in his hero's footsteps and always search for the truth. Looking at the world from the viewpoint of such a highly intelligent, curious, and affectionate child makes the reader see things in a new way. 
 Something Alex says really sums up everything he (and we), learn from his journey. ""What if the times when we feel love and act brave and tell the truth are all the times when we're four-dimensional, the times we're as big and everywhere as the cosmos, the times when we remember, like, REALLY remember, really KNOW, that we're made of starstuff and we're human beings from the planet Earth..."" We can all use a reminder now and then that we are made of starstuff.

 The illustrations remind me of one other book from the same timeframe, which explored a male figure as a babysitter. They are realistic and full of detail yet stylistic to be on their own timeframe altogether. 
 The writing of the story itself is kind of long so beginning readers may have problems with reading a story this long and a lot younger audiences may get bored with the book while having it read to them.

There's just something incredibly fun in most children's books that seems to stretch across the age boundaries, if that book is well written. Since this book has been written by the author of Shiloh, you can expect it to be an entertaining read. 
 Emily's mother is a housekeeper for the insanely wealthy Mrs. Nash (emphasis on the insane). When an overturned buggy turns her into an orphan, Emily knows that the only place left for her is with her Aunt Hilda in Redbud. The only other known relative is the dastardly Uncle Victor, an awful man who has never treated Emily or her mother well. With child catchers & an evil uncle to avoid & an unexpected inheritance to claim, Emily is finding that the road to her new home is more difficult to travel than she'd expected, even if she does have her new friend Jackson & her pet turtle Rufus to help her along the way. 
 Parents, rest assured that this book is appropriate for your children. While there are two deaths at the beginning of the book, there isn't anything objectionable in this book. There's a nice adventure here, but no real threats. You won't have to worry about nightmares or overly gory scenes in this book. 
 Now for my opinions on the book. Even though I loved the descriptions of Emily's original life, I felt like the book was a little slow to start out. It really isn't until Victor makes his first appearance in the book that I felt that the story really came to life. The characters in this book are really cute & I liked Emily & Jackson's interactions. I also thought that the illustrations were incredibly charming & easily my favorite part of the book. I also enjoyed the cute endings to each chapter, which made the book feel as if it was a tale being read by firelight to a group of children for fun. Basically put, this book just made me smile at how cute it was. 
 I know that if I'd read this book when I was about 8, I'd have adored it & I'm pretty sure that the average young reader will as well. As it is, I'm certain that my niece will love the plucky Emily & my nephew will like reading about stagecoaches & devious uncles.",4,1.067,0.644,0.998

623,"Crenshaw is a bittersweet tale about a family going through economic hardship. Jackson is a scientist, a skeptic, and nobody's fool. He may not know the exact details of his family's strife, but he knows that his parents are overwhelmed and that they had to live in their car for sometime. Jackson knows that his parents need help, but they keep in arm's length away from their problems and keep reassuring him and his sister that ""everything is fine"", but he knows this isn't true. When Jackson's family faces homelessness once again, his former imaginary friend, a giant cat named Crenshaw who's visible only to Jackson, makes a reappearance. 
 Crenshaw is neither cute nor obviously supportive. He appears at odd times, takes bubble baths, constantly asks for purple jelly beans, and gives him enigmatic pithy advice. Jackson tries to banish him, but Crenshaw insists that he has been summoned. At first I wasn't sure what to think of having an imaginary friend as a plot device and metaphor, but somehow Applegate makes it work. Crenshaw is both real and imaginary; a symbol of Jackson's faint strands of innocence, but also Jackson's growing confidence that he is old enough to be told the harsh truths about his reality. 
 Jackson's family is loving, optimistic, and functional in its way, but the tenuousness of the family's situation and Jackson's lack of control over his own fate are stressful and sadly realistic. The tone is warm and occasionally funny, but Applegate doesn't sugarcoat the hardships of Jackson's family, the effects of hunger and the uncertainty of the future. The story does end on a hopeful note.",4,0.304,-0.121,0.803

626,"This book will be in stores 18/04/17. 
 Yay for more indigenous voices in YA literature! Jennifer Frick-Ruppert transports readers back to pre-European contact America in what today would be the state of North Carolina. Skyco is a member of the Algonquin nation and is about to begin the all important transition from childhood to adulthood by making his spirit quest. Along with other young men of the tribe, Skyco is given a teacher and must complete a series of tasks that will lead him to his destiny. Will Skyco be the next chief of his tribe? Or will he become a medicine man? 
 Heavily researched, imagine my surprise when I completed the book and discovered that Skyco was a real person. It certainly adds an extra dimension to the story. The author's note was quite fascinating and is accompanied with an appendix of Algonquin vocabulary. Due to the latter, I would suggest that readers find a bound copy rather than an ebook so that you can flip back and forth. 
 ""Spirit Quest"" transported me to the right time and place and rang true about Native American life before interactions with the Europeans. The story affirms the customs and teachings of the people with a great deal of respect and the illustrations created by Lorna Murphy are carefully placed within the text. 
 Although this book didn't have me on the edge of my seat, I really liked the story for its focus on the teachings of the Algonquin nation.

 The Paperboy is a Caldecott Honor book written and illustrated by Dav Pilkey, most famous for his Captain Underpants series. Unlike those books, this one is much more subdued and sentimental as it tells about the work of a paperboy and his pudgy dog. Though there is not much to the story - the boy wakes up, delivers his papers, and goes home, the real appeal of this story is in its earthy illustrations which invoke the solitude of the early morning.

634,"FAV QUOTES: 
 I'm inventing as we go along. 
 Isn't every dream a story, though when we try to tell it, we may forget some of the pieces? 
 ""And what is the use of a book,"" thought Alice, ""without pictures or conversation?"" 
 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. 
 She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it). 
 But Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. 
 ""Curiouser and curiouser!"" cried Alice. 
 Dear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle! 
 ""Found what?"" said the Duck. 
 ""Found it,"" the Mouse replied rather crossly: ""of course you know what 'it' means."" 
 When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one! 
 At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then. 
 ""I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir,"" said Alice, ""because I'm not myself, you see."" 
 How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! 
 She considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish. 
 ""If everybody minded their own business,"" the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, ""the world would go round a deal faster than it does."" 
 ""Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"" 
 ""That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,"" said the Cat. 
 ""I don't care much where--"" said Alice. 
 ""Then it doesn't matter which way you go,"" said the Cat. 
 ""--so long as I get somewhere,"" Alice added as an explanation. 
 ""Oh, you're sure to do that,"" said the Cat, ""if you only walk long enough."" 
 ""Oh, you can't help that,"" said the Cat: ""we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."" 
 ""Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,"" thought Alice, ""but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!"" 
 Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 
 ""You can draw water out of a water well,"" said the Hatter; ""so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well--eh, stupid?"" 
 ""I don't think--"" 
 ""Then you shouldn't talk,"" said the Hatter. 
 Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it. 
 Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round! 
 The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours. 
 ""I quite agree with you,"" said the Duchess; ""and the moral of that is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or if you'd like it put more simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.'""",4,0.379,0.31,0.914

639,"Fascinating combination of talking-animal stories with science fiction, one that I hope will find a lot of fans in its age group. (In my experience, there's a pretty big crossover between hardxcore animal kids and robot enthusiasts, so I think.) The animals are funny and engaging without acting too much like humans--Brown's characterization of them reminds me a lot of Avi's Poppy series. 
 That the titular robot is a girl is a serious delight to me, especially when her design doesn't feature any secondary sex characteristics that scream LOOK THIS IS A GIRL ROBOT GIRL GIRL GIRL. There's nothing about her that suggests the fact that she's female is anything noteworthy or unusual within her world, just a plain and simple fact. And the ending of the book is straight out of classic science fiction, which makes this a great way to introduce the genre. It's also a built-in class assignment, to be honest--what happens to Roz when she returns to the robots' factory? Write, draw, imagine the answer. 
 This would make a wonderful read-aloud, even for very young children, since the chapters are short and the period illustrations are beautiful. It does include violence and death--I mean, it's nature, of course it does--so pre-read it, but please share this one with everyone you know.",5,1.412,0.738,0.963
640,"Brief thoughts originally published 18 May 2017 at Falling Letters. 
 I'm going to talk about this book from my personal perspective, a White girl who attended church as a kid. Many of my friends also attended Sunday school. I didn't know anyone who was particularly zealous about it. For most of us, it was just something we did. In Amina's Voice, going to a mosque, participating in a religious community, etc. are everyday activities - ones that won't seem so 'foreign' for church going kids. 
 Some of Amina's problems come from those activities (she has to participate in a Qu'ran recitation competition but she has severe stage fright), but she worries about her friendships as much as you would except a middle grader to. The relationships Amina has with her friends and family felt very realistic. Her parents are positive figures in her life. In particular, I appreciated the missteps and assumptions she made about her friendships with Soojin and Emily. There is a lot for readers to connect with in this book, whether in the joys and trials Amina finds in her religion or in her relationships with friends and family.",5,-0.143,0.647,0.966

643,"Mozart is known far and wild as the child prodigy who gave us hundreds of sonatas, orchestras, and operas. In this book we meet him during his earliest performing days and follow him as he begins composing for a living. 
 This book is divided into two sections - the first fifteen pages tell us about Mozart himself, and the last eight tell us how we can find out more about him and listen to his music. 
 On page 13 Mozart's Magic Flute is mentioned and is accompanied by an illustration of a woman dressed in all black wearing a spiky crown and scepter and looking generally occultic. 
 Conclusion. Not overly informative - would function equally as well as a beginning reader or read aloud.

655,"Billy and his mom just moved to a new town, but it's not quite the fresh start everyone wanted. Billy's got a bad leg thanks to the drunk driving accident that also killed his dad, and the kids at his new school aren't very nice about it. But when Billy buys a pony from a local circus, his life starts to get interesting. The pony is actually a unicorn; it's not very obvious for her, but her foal leaves no doubts. But when his classmates set the town on a unicorn hunt, Billy and Nico escape into the desert. But can they escape all of their pursuers, including a hungry mountain lion? 
 This is very much a younger children's book. Older readers should be able to figure out where the plot is going simply based on the fact that there's a lame boy and a unicorn in the same place. Although it's easy to guess Billy will walk out of this on two strong legs, it's interesting to see how he gets there. The flight across the desert is almost half the book, and it's an amusing bit of adventure (though personally, I was rooting for the mountain lion). 
 For a younger children's book, this still touched on a few harder topics, such as drunk driving and single motherhood and living with a deformity. The only thing that struck me as out of place was the fact that Billy and Carolyn were falling in love. They're eleven. Isn't that a bit young? And even if Carolyn had a crush on Billy, don't boys usually take longer than girls to start playing that game? 
 I picked this book up only because I liked the cover, but I do like it, if only for the nice chase scene. Billy getting kidnapped by a unicorn does have amusing moments. Given the age of the audience, the book doesn't have much of a plot; I'd give it a Recommended, but only if you enjoy reading very simple stories.",4,0.296,0.445,0.974

Lord Ashton of Ashton Place found three children in his woods and decided to keep them. (Can you play finder's keepers with people?) Ashton and his newly wed wife employ fresh-faced Penelope Lumley to take the children in hand. The story follows Miss Lumley as she strives to train and education three rambunctious children. 
 Reader Katherine Kellgren gives an outstanding performance that will be enjoyed by the whole family. Each voice is very distinguishable and full of life.

670,"I had of course read this as a kid, remembered I had liked it but couldn't really remember what it was about. 
 Rereading it now: It really is a beautiful little short story -- although I'd, as a responsible adult, be afraid to have little kids read it for fear it might give them ideas. 
 The story surrounds two kids who run away from home and take up residence at the Metropolitan Museum in NYC. They managed to survive there for a few days undiscovered, hiding from the guards and sleeping in one of the antique beds before deciding to head home. The one thing that irritated me as unrealistic was while they discovered they could find change to live on in the fountain of the museum's restaurant they somehow never thought to check its kitchens for food even though they were described as hungry throughout. 
 What makes the story so wonderful is the relationship between the two siblings and the way they choose to spend their days. These are two very likable little kids and Konigsburg's imagery is wonderful. 
 I remembered, as a kid reading it the first time being irritated because the book's title was about Mrs Basil E Frankweiler and her files... which in fact are only a tiny fraction of the story at almost the very end... and I had kept thinking ""when do we get to the files?"" only to be ultimately let down by them. As an adult I still think the book's title is misleading, and that Konisburg kind of takes a sudden left hand turn in the attempt to give the story some sort of deeper meaning... I can see where she's going with it but even as an adult I kind of felt it was the least interesting part of the book. Also I think the surprise ""twist"" at the end kind of ruins the story and was not only utterly unnecessary but in fact cheapened the actions of Mrs Frankweiler.",5,0.438,0,0.629

675,"I enjoyed the fairy tale characters and especially Goldilocks' story line. If it weren't for them I don't think I'd have rated this even a three. 
 It's not a bad book. It's a good time waster and is rather enjoyable at certain parts but I could not stand the twins. I hated Conner's ""jokes"" which where actually really annoying and hurtful. Alex was less annoying but still irritating at times. The big ""surprises"" at the end were not really surprising and quite predictable.

 I believe this is Colfer's first book so I understand some of the lack of descriptions and the way it seemed like parts were glossed over quickly. It was rather repetitive at some points, using the same phases over and over. I think he is a good author and with time he will become a great one.

686,"One of the most satisfying experiences a human being can have is reading a book to one of your children that you read (and loved) as a child. I discovered ""Flight of the Doves"" when I was a teenager. I remember how it caught my imagination. A 12-year-old boy, in an attempt to protect his gentle, innocent little sister from an abusive step-father, runs away with her. He is trying to get to a village with a name he doesn't know in a country that is not his own. His grandmother lives there and he has foggy memories of her from when he was young. The odds are against them. Not only does he not know the way, but his step father learns of a legacy left to the children (after they ran away) and is motivated to bring them home. The police are on the hunt, rewards bring other adventurers after the children. What really warms the book is how people step in to help the children, some knowingly and others in ignorance. The boy is no superhero and knows he will fail without the help of others. The Doves' flight is very human and grounded. There are no green screens, explosions, violence, or sex--just two children who want a chance to find someone who loves them and find love and kindness amid their adventures on their way there. My daughter blessed me by loving the book as much as I did. She reads as well as I do, but it was great reading this out loud with her.",5,0.722,0.83,0.992

 Felicity the Dragon is an adorable tale of how children with low self-esteem or that feel different, can triumph and make friends while being honest to themselves.

713,"If you don't already know the story of Juneteenth Day, this book won't enlighten you until you get to the author's notes at the back of the book. By starting at the end, you will learn that at the conclusion of the Civil War, many slaves did not yet know they were now free. [The author errs in her note (although not in her timeline) by stating that slaves were free as of the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. This was a wartime measure and in any event did not free all the slaves; some 800,000 slaves in the border states alone were unaffected by the measure. It was not until the return of the Confederate states to the Union (for which a renunciation of slavery was mandatory) and their acceptance of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in December of 1865, that slavery was officially abolished. In the meantime, however, Southern States remained under military government. Thus, the notification of June 19th was in the form of a military order.] 
 Even after slavery became illegal, slave owners in Texas did not volunteer the news to their slaves. It was only when Union Major General Gordon Granger came to Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865 and made the announcement, that slaves understood they were officially free from bondage. [And often, as historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. reports, slaves took advantage of their promised freedom at some peril.] 
 The author observes that awareness of the significance of this date increased during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, and the date is now celebrated throughout the nation. 
 The book takes us through a summer day for slaves on a Texas plantation, slaves who do not realize that ""soon, it would all be different."" As the news spreads, more and more people gather and: 
 ""...we ate as a free people, 
 laughed as a free people, 
 and told stories as free people 
 on 
 into 
 the night."" 
 The little girl who is telling the story muses that in the morning, when they wake again, it will be a time that is ""all different now."" 
 Illustrator E.B. Lewis does a remarkable job with muted watercolors in capturing the range of emotions that slaves must have felt upon learning they were free, from shock to disbelief to hope to ineffable joy. He also makes great use of shadow and changes in light to show the rhythms of the day. 
 Evaluation: While the illustrations are lovely, I would have liked to have seen some background information made available before the end notes, which in any event are geared toward adults.

 There cannot be a bond as pure as the one formed through feelings of forgiveness and kindness. There is no thing greater than humanity.

The book contains enchanting descriptions of everything that is beautiful around us. It takes you to the innocent hills and makes you climb down the mighty crevices. When the birds are described you will literally find yourself listening to their happy chirps. I dont find myself even slightly worthy to rate a tale so pure and sensitive.

746,"Okay, so I was just kidding when I shelved this as Biography. But the book does use the tone and structure of a biographical picturebook! 
 I'm going to go out on a limb here and declare the 'Reality of Santa Claus' book its own genre. It's really unlike any other holiday or occasional books, especially in the way it walks a line between fiction and non-fiction. Each author makes up different facts for the Santa story, so 'fiction' right? But the biographical structures in these stories so often fit exactly with the 'mythmaking' tradition we know from biographies of great figures like Abraham Lincoln and MLK (which are supposed to be non-fiction, but where authors also have clearly 'made up' an ideological vision and agenda). 
 I'm going to use a Randy Jackson rating--it was a-ight, a little pitchy. The story was playful enough to read, but bothersome in spots. Hawkes and Barrett have launched a thinly veiled attempt to unseat William Joyce as reigning king of 1930s-50s Christmas nostalgia (who in turn had to unseat Van Allsburg). The thin veil is Hawkes' painterly less-airbrushed style, which is more interesting to look at than Joyce's work. But the art deco toys and the red-cheeked, button-nosed figures all owe royalties to Joyce. Chart some new territory, gang! 
 The Santa we worship in America clearly emerged from the 1930s-50s, at the hands of mythmakers like songwriter Gene Autry. So Barrett's 'what if he was from Cincinnati' premise is worth the effort, but ends up flawed. Examples? 1. The idea that the naughty-nice list was purely a matter of industrial efficiency is weak, and b. The elves appear out of nowhere with no text to position them in the story! Don't editors read books before sending them to the printer anymore? I understand willing suspension of disbelief, but this is a major gap in a book that is supposed to provide an accounting for all the facts in the Santa story. If you have to explain the toys and the reindeer, you have to explain the elves. 
 What would be fun is a 'Reality of Santa' book based on primary sources! Jed and Jennifer were involved in a mockumentary a few years ago called Stalking Santa (great word play with 'stalking'), where a guy dedicates everything he has to finding proof of Santa's existence. That was a lot of fun. 
 As a believer and traditionalist, I prefer to stick with Mason & Hinke's Jolly Old Santa Claus or the sappy Rudolph book by May & Gillen. We own Joyce's Santa Calls and Van Allsburg's Polar Express, but Cincinnati was not much of a contribution to the genre.",2,1.3,0.673,0.996
747,"Ella has some glow in the dark stickers, but the closet is too scary to go into to see if they work, so Ella and Penguin try other places like behind the shower curtain and under a laundry basket, but eventually have to be brave enough to go into the dark closet to see the magic of the glow in the dark stickers. 
 This is a story about supporting your friends and being patient with them. It is a good book for talking about being afraid of the dark. Penguin is adorable, but I couldn't help wishing Penguin was another child, rather than an animal. Oh, and it doesn't actually glow - that was very disappointing. Some glow in the dark stickers would have made this so much better.

 http://bookunderthesun.blogspot.com/2... 
 Although the novella is meant originally as a children's story, quite a number of English terms are difficult for beginners of the language, such as baobab, conceit and tippler. If you are reading to your kids, you may want to spend time explaining these terms to them and improve their vocabulary list. 
 The theme of this story revolves around the view of adults from a child's eyes, which usually finds that matters of consequence to adults are actually quite meaningless. Also worth noting is that the persistent Little Prince is much like most kids, not letting go of a question once it is asked. 
 To the Little Prince, the view of adults are almost always focused on the outlook, not the essence. I have to say, I do agree on that: as an adult myself, I am constantly falling prey to this kind of perception, looking at things the way they are, but not interested in its essence. In other words, we adults are materialistic. 
 For a children's book, I admit that the ending is surprisingly sad. Tears welled upon my eyes at the end of the story, and I could understand why the story was lauded as one of the best story throughout the century. If your kid understands the sadness behind the ending and weep along, it would very well mean that he has a heart as innocent as the little prince, and that he requires your love and care as much as the little protagonist did. And if you did as well, that means that there is still a little prince in your heart, that innocence lost after all the affairs with grown-ups, just as I did.",5,0.45,0.389,0.948

""Last Stop on Market Street"" is a picture book, also nominated for the Caldecott, about a boy and his grandmother in San Francisco who take the bus after church every week to go and work in a soup kitchen. Really, it is about how we should appreciate the good things we have and not dwell on the things we don't have. It is a sweet book and my 2-year-old son enjoyed it (although I don't know how much of it he ""got""), which is not something you hear often about a Newberry winner.",3,2.333,2.565,0.951

I personally feel it is discouraging kids to read. I understand that lots of movies are based on books, but it seems that a new trend is to make movies based on really popular books. Anyway, I wanted my kids to hear the book before seeing the movie. I actually wasn't impressed with this book at all. It moved pretty slowly and it didn't seem to make any good connections to make me really ""feel"". I would rate this a very much a childrens books.

757,"Despite being a short little children's book, I firmly believe that this is one of the best stories of all time. It's about a girl who goes exploring on her pony, Panda, on their new property, and stumbles upon an abandoned stone house. Although it sounds like a pony is trapped inside, the only thing there is a skeleton with a rotted halter bearing the nameplate ""Oberon."" (This is some of the spookiest imagery I have ever read.) 
 How the pony came to be inside the house in the first place* is a mystery that leads Sarah to a nursing home. With Panda as a visual aid, the tragic story is slowly drawn out of a man in the early stages of Alzheimer's. It's heartbreaking and sentimental all at once, with just enough supernatural imagery to raise goosebumps. It was also the adventure I always wanted to have, which may explain why I read it so many times. 
 *For those who want to know what happened: 
 There used to be a stable of pit ponies on her property, until the mines were shut down and the ponies were all sold. The groom, who had come with them from Ireland, couldn't bear losing them all (""Ah, a black day. You haven't lived long enough to guess at the sorrow. They took my girls away from me. They took my Apple and Mari and the dear others."") and stole the stallion he'd raised from birth to hide away, intending to return for him once the search died down. Worst case scenario, he knew that Oberon was smart enough to open any door. Unfortunately, not only was the groom arrested on suspicion of the theft before he could go back, the door had a special latch - so in the height of tragedy, since the groom was too terrified of receiving a prison sentence to talk, the pony died of thirst before they released him from county lockup.",5,-1.045,-0.717,-0.978

761,"I went to the bookstore a bit before catching the train home yesterday. I saw this book and I remembered that it was on my TBR list so I picked it up. :D 
 The book is pretty funny and also relevant to today. I was laughing at some points because the whole thing was pretty funny especially with the pictures. Especially when the grandma started taking away all the technology and throwing it out the window and her family was looking so horrified and trying to make a leap for their stuff. Haha. It's funny too because it says our technology will still be waiting for us in the morning. And it will, but after grandma tossed it out the window, it wouldn't be fully functioning. Haha. It made me laugh even more because I can imagine people actually doing that and reacting that way. :D 
 I also thought it was a good book because it is relevant to today. It shows us how we are so into our cell phones, TV, and other technology, how technology has come to be a major part of our lives, when sometimes we just need to unplug everything and spend more time with each other and less time with our technology. And it showed us how sometimes we lose sleep because we are so mesmerized by our technology.

I would recommend this for children and adults alike.

It may seem like a difficult task, but ""Nature's Patchwork Quilt: Understanding Habitats"" does an excellent job of educating readers about the beautiful and mysterious places humans, plants and animals call home. 
 Although this is a book meant to educate and inspire children of all ages to learn and care for the world they live in, it is also an appropriate book for children who may not be reading yet. There are lots of pictures to look at that include a wide variety of animals and plants in their respective habitats. Preschoolers can look at pictures with adults or older children and talk about the animals that live in different regions of the world.

My boys are 9 and 14 and I was hoping to find a few that were a bit older for them instead of all the younger kid books. While this one had a great story it was also a bit longer than we were used to. Part of that I'm sure was we were rushing when we read it this year and the wording tripped me up a bit with how the family talked. Hopefully next year it won't seem as long when we read it as it's a good story and seeing as there is an orange in everyone's stocking each year, this give them something to think about when they pull it out of their stocking on Christmas morning.",4,2.5,2.197,0.93

788,"When twelve-year-old Tim Hunter steals his sister Kat's diary, he gets a lot more than he'd bargained for. His older siblings, Ron and Kat, chase Tim through his grandmother's Connecticut home - a place where they had all lived since their stepfather, Erick, had mysteriously disappeared two months earlier. Before he realizes it, Tim discovers that he is on the forbidden third floor of the house, locked inside a room with his scary Uncle Edgar. As Tim tries to escape, Edgar distracts him by unveiling a mirror which had once belonged to the Brothers Grimm. From an inscription in the gold frame, Tim learns that the mirror is magical and is a gateway to another world. Tim, Ron and Kat soon find themselves on the other side of the mirror in a medieval land of castles and dangerous beasts. They might have thought of it as a fun adventure, were it not for a prophecy which tells of three strangers from a faraway land who would defeat the evil Queen Morissa, returning King Gunther and Prince Gavril to the throne and thus restoring order to the land of Tryton. When given only two choices - fulfil the prophecy or be executed - the three siblings are told of the simple task ahead of them of stealing the queen's mirror, but what they find instead is a truth which is too shocking to believe. 
 Without a doubt, The Mirror of Doom is the most delightful children's story I have read in some time, with three squabbling children, none of whom possess an ounce of responsibility, suddenly realizing that they have to trust and rely on each other in order to survive. Bailey Baxter's tale of typical teens was written in a realistic fashion up until the fantasy realm takes over, when they are magically transported to another world. Tim's humorous narration of the story gave me cause to chuckle in many instances, as he told things from a twelve-year old's point of view, inclusive of his personal analysis of each of the other characters in the story, holding nothing back. All three of the children are initially shown as quite self-absorbed and selfish, but their emotional growth and respect for one another is evident as they face each challenge head-on. I noticed that The Mirror of Doom has been left open at the end to allow for the possibility of a sequel. I very much look forward to reading that too. Bailey Baxter is a writer with great talent and has a flair for telling stories of intrigue to readers of all ages. I recommend The Mirror of Doom to all readers who enjoy fun, action, sci-fi, fantasy, and a major dose of comedy in their magical adventures.

809,"This book is like the first two- it follows Harry Potter and his third year at Hogwarts school for wizards and witches. It is fast paced and a easy read. 
 This year, Harry's godfather- and good friend to Harry's parents, Lily and James Potter- escaped from prison, trying to get into Hogwarts. So the school is flanked by dementors, the guards from Azkaban, to try and capture the escapee, Sirius Black. 
 Did Sirius Betray the Potters? Was he really a spy for Voldemort? An. Was he going to finish off Harry? These questions and more- like what happens to Ron's rat scabbers?- are answered in this book. 
 I slightly remember the movie, but only brief moments, so it didn't interfere too much with reading.

813,"One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun--which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes. 
 The Secret Garden is a book that contains magic. The simple yet powerful way it describes the world is magical. Its miraculous victories of the the body overcoming illness due to the mind are magical. This book is wonderful, childish magic in its purest form, it makes one's soul feel that of a child again, and gives one hope for the world and its hardships; that, by the power of belief and love anything is possible. 
 This book, though I have never read it until now, shame on me, encompasses my childhood in one book of 227 pages. The innocent quality of it gently reminds me of those times, and helps remind me that, those times may still remain. The power of friendship, hope and belief for things to come true, can still be valid, no matter what age you are. That, no matter who we are and what we've become, those values can stay long after we've grown up. 
 I can't stop thinking about this book. It haunts me in the best of ways, and I will definitely visit it again in the years to come.",4,0.52,0.806,0.988

816,"I truly enjoyed Milo. When I first saw it, I thought it was going to be another poor attempt at imitating the success of Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. Although similar in visual style and in the genuineness of the narrator's voice, Milo stands on its own as a remarkable addition to this year's Lovelace Nominees. 
 Milo is in love with a girl at his school--although they have never even spoken and she has no idea who he is. Having moved multiple times in the last couple years Milo is once again the ""new kid"" at his school. In order to face the anxiety associated with both his unfamiliarity with the school and his crush on Summer Goodman he creates a suave, confident alter ego to tell him what to do at school--a way to come outside himself. 
 Although the author ultimately neglects the 'alter ego' idea (one of the few flaws in the plot--to introduce it and then not use it) it does give the reader a subtle 'heads up' that Milo NEEDS a way to step outside of himself and his home life. A little further into the story we discover that Milo's frequent moving has occurred in the wake of his mother's death from cancer. 
 Milo is confused, grief-stricken and angry with his mother: for dying; and his father: for failing to communicate any emotion or understanding to his son and for trying to wipe his mother's existence away. Milo's father has given or thrown away everything that belonged to Milo's mother as a result of his own grief. Everything in their home, their lives have become silent. There is no music, no laughing, no joking, no real talking or living any more. Milo wants it all back but cannot figure out how to give voice to those feelings. 
 Milo IS able to identify that his crush on Summer has the effect of diverting his concentration from the sadness that pervades every aspect of his home existence. And it also leads him accidentally into friendships with two of his other classmates--friendships that will prove more satisfying in the end than his crush. 
 Although I was disappointed in what I felt was an unrealistic (and unnecessary) resolution to Milo's relationship with Summer in a final scene, I enjoyed my reading experience with Milo immensely. The result of Milo's garage sale excursions, as well as the willingness and generosity with which his new friends participate and support him, was one of the most moving scenes in the book for me. 
 This book combines some of the best elements of middle school humor with the honesty of grief from a middle school student perspective. As children we all have the ability to make our parents' happiness our responsibility when we really just want to be kids, have fun and have our parents stay in the roles we have assigned them as our protectors, cheerleaders and nurturers. Milo speaks to all the confusing feelings and misguided actions so many of us have (or ARE) experiencing. For this reason, perhaps more than any other,Milo: Sticky Notes and Brain Freeze has the potential to touch both student and adult readers alike.",5,-0.086,0.104,0.991
817,"'Daddy by Default' is a story about dealing with the unexpected. In Derek's case it is the death of his parents, followed by that of the younger sister he raised, and ending up becoming the guardian of her baby, Jason, the only one to survive the accident. For Chance it is the realization that his bachelor lifestyle may not be what is going to make him happy for the rest of his life and that having kids may be exactly what he wants. Neither Derek nor Chance is hurting financially, but both of them are in dire need of a partner who understands and accepts them just the way they are. This story is about their unexpected meeting, surprising courtship, and joint decisions about the right way forward. It's gentle, peaceful, yet very real in the way these two men deal with the cards life has dealt them. 
 Derek has had a lot to deal with. He is the only one left of his small family, and suddenly faces the fact that he is now responsible for a newborn. Derek has no financial worries, being the owner of a pharmaceutical company, but he knows from hard-won personal experience that money isn't everything. He works hard, takes care of Jason, and that leaves no time for a social or personal life. Yes, he has a nanny and other staff to help him, but the ultimate responsibility is his, and he takes it very seriously. And anyway, how can he be sure any potential partner isn't just after his money? 
 Chance is a successful photojournalist, and while he is a freelancer, he mostly works for Today's Baby Magazine. Without any intention whatsoever to end his enjoyable bachelor lifestyle by burdening himself with kids, he still likes them well enough from a distance. He has a large family with several brothers and sisters who provide him with nieces and nephews, and that is all he wants. Or so he thinks. Then he meets Derek and Jason while out in the park, jogging. Suddenly he faces an attraction to Derek that is hard to resist, and Jason's charm doesn't help push him away. Chance has a lot of thinking to do, but I think that his heart has already made the decision long before his brain catches up. 
 If you like stories that deal with significant changes in life, if two men who meet by coincidence, then decide they may belong together sound interesting, and if you're looking for a slow-burning love story with an adorable kid as part of the equation, then you will probably like this novella.

823,"No Bears written by Meg McKinlay and illustrated by Leila Rudge is a fun picturebook in which young Ella declares that she is going to tell her own story. What will make her story the best, is that there will be absolutely no bears in the tale. There will be princesses, funny things, pretty things, magic things, and exciting things, but no bears! The story elements are fun and brightly illustrated, rich in irony as a bear plays some very important parts in the story. 
 No Bears is a fun story about an imaginative child taking charge of where that imagination takes her. She loves princesses, castles, and all the things that tend to make for a good fairy tale. For some reason, she does not think bears fit in a good story, so wants to leave them out. However, the watercolor illustrations show readers that a bear, much like a parent that makes things happen for their child regardless of whether it is appreciated or even noticed, tends to play an important role in the story. The book is fun, and has something special for readers of all ages. 
 I highly recommend No Bears to readers of all ages, particularly for those that have active imaginations. The idea of making up your own story, and living it, is something my children are already well versed in. But, this might just insight those a little more timid in engaging their imagination to dust it off and put it to work.",4,1.462,1.718,0.996

Then, there is Grace who is painfully shy and quiet always worrying that no one understands how she sees the world.

Words to describe how she is feeling are hard to find for the first time in Ava's life and I think that is the perfect way to illustrate what it means to have your first crush, you just can't find a way to say what is going on in your head or with your feelings and that is so realistic. 
 Also, she is approached with some bullying and body shaming issues and also finds that this isn't a topic that is easy to understand or explain. She tries to help but that also isn't the easiest task she has ever undertaken. 
 I think this last installment is very age appropriate and topical and that any middle school aged student would gain a lot from reading it. 
 Series: 
 Overall, a phenomenal collections of middle grade stories told through the importance of writing and language and with a tenacious main character that you can't help but love. 
 I will say that I do see these stories appealing more to a female reader than a male reader but they are definitely age appropriate and cover a wide range of topics and introduce children to social issues such as bullying, body shaming, pet adoption, friendship, family, and so much more.

 In fact, 10-year-old Mary is so contrary it gives her a sour expression and no one likes her. While growing up in India, Mary's parents don't pay any attention to her. When there is a cholera outbreak and her nanny, mother, and father die all the servants flee forgetting about Mary and abandoning her to an empty house. When she is found alone, she is shipped off to an uncle, Archibald Craven, in England who doesn't want to have anything to do with her as well. Isolated and alone in her uncle's big mansion on the Moors, Mary is befriended by Martha, the maidservant, who tells her the story of how her uncle's wife died falling from a tree in a garden on the grounds. Mr. Craven was so distraught by her death that he locked the garden up, threw away the key, and commanded that no one enter the garden again. This was 10 years ago. Fascinated by the hidden garden, Mary is determined to find it. With the help of a robin she discovers the key and the garden. When she decides to plant seeds she seeks the help of Martha who introduces Mary to her brother, Dickon, a twelve-year-old boy who can talk to animals and is adored by all who meet him. They forge a friendship and Mary soon finds her sour face replaced by a happy smile. 
 One night Mary is awakened by crying and discovers Mr. Craven's ten-year-old sickly son, Colin, who has never walked and who people thought would die shortly after he was born. He is more contrary than Mary and has screaming temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way. Mary stands up to him like no one ever has and snaps him back to life by telling him about the secret garden. He wants to see the garden so much that he works on getting stronger believing the garden has Magic that can heal him from his sickness. The garden heals more than just Colin. 
 This story doesn't have much action. The plot progresses from the tension created by the characters internal changes to happy, healthy children. Published in 1911, the author's heavy emphasis on nature is typical of the Romantic Era where strong emotions are expressed when the character confronts nature in its wildness and beauty. Mary's joy is extreme and melodramatic when seeing the blue sky or flowers budding or a robin building a nest. For Colin nature is like a religious experience. For instance, he is so thrilled with the growth of the garden he recites the Doxology. 
 Students might struggle with the characters using a Yorkshire accent. The vocabulary is high and the content deals with death and grief. The garden is a symbol of rebirth for two children who have been abandoned by their parents. Dickon is like the god, Pan and Susan Sowerby is the motherly figure.

 Highlights: 
 1) Barbara Caruso's voice - First time listening to her and I am a fan. Her Anne's voice reminds me of a young version of Julie Andrews's Maria in the movie, ""The Sound of Music"". Caruso has a very beautiful classic voice. 
 2) Anne's thoughts - I had a hard time keeping a straight face while listening to this book in public. Anne's thoughts/words are hilarious - starts with a single thought and goes off on a tangent. Montgomery does a great job in giving a wonderful character and also developing it realistically over a period of 5 years. I loved the way she used specific adjectives to describe things depending on the intensity. Overall her thoughts remind me to take pleasure in everyday simple things. 
 3) Marilla's sarcasm - Absolutely enjoyed her dry humour. Caruso's deadpan delivery enhances Marilla's sarcastic tone. 
 4) Anne's interactions - Loved how Anne finds a kindred spirit in Matthew, a bosom friend in Diana, a arch-enemy in Gilbert, a mentor in Mrs.Allen.

Oftentimes, those books are a whirlwind of emotion, going through all the ups and downs, and you finish the book with laughter and tears all around you. Sparrow Road grabbed me by the heart and didn't let go. But it didn't do it in a whirlwind. It was with understated and lighthearted tact, coming together to be the full story, told exactly as it needed to be. 
 Raine O'Rourke is a 12-year old (almost 13!) spending the second half of her summer at Sparrow Road, a former orphanage. Her mother made the decision to bring her here seemingly last-minute, and there's a definite mystery as to why. As Raine pieces it together, we see the world of Sparrow Road, and nearby town Comfort, come alive before us. Garbage turns to art as Raine grows up with the artists now living at Sparrow Road.

898,"What business do a whale and a mouse have becoming friends? None, some would say; yet Amos and Boris together somehow form one of the truly beautiful friendships in the recent history of literature. Their connection is one of symbiotic ponderance, in which they talk with each other about their mutually exclusive habitats and, linked together, see the majesty of the world around them through eyes that neither has on his own. 
 Amos, the mouse, meets Boris, the whale, under far less than ideal circumstances, the former having rolled off his boat in the middle of an exploratory sea voyage, and now languishing in the sea as his tiny body tires in the massive expanse of salt water. Boris surfaces beside Amos just when his strength has ebbed to near empty, and saves the mouse's life, and neither one will ever forget what comes about as a result of that happenstance. When Amos is able to unexpectedly return the favor to his friend many years later, the reunion between the old friends is truly something for the reader to cherish in his heart, and the eventual parting of the duo is bittersweetly touching to an extent that one just doesn't find in very many picture books. Then again, William Steig is the master. 
 Amos & Boris is memorable and compelling in every way, capturing the essence of unorthodox friendship and demonstrating why it can be so sweet. The language is uncommonly beautiful for a story of its brevity, and the characters are thoughtfully fashioned. I would recommend this small jewel for any sensitive and receptive reader.",3,1.545,1.358,0.994

I just had to see what happened with Dwight and Origami Yoda. And just who created Darth Paper? And what would this mean to the balance in The Force at McQuarrie Middle School? 
 This book did not disappoint. We got to know each character a bit more, especially Dwight. It is still told in the same format- a different student writes each chapter, the narrator's gives his editorial comments, and the illustrations are hysterical.

Unlike Escape from Mr. Lemocello's Library (which Bertman's book will be compared to throughout its life--unfortunately, because Bertman's is much better), the main character is not simply solving a game. She's dealing with best friend issues and figuring out what it means to be a friend. She's dealing family issues. There's a meanie at school. I could go on, but the point is: Emily has depth and I appreciated that. If it had simply been about the puzzle, I don't think I could've finished the book. 
 But don't get me wrong--the puzzle is fascinating, too. Mainly because it ties in actual location history (San Francisco) and actual literary history (especially stuff surrounding the life of Edgar Allen Poe) that it becomes fun and educational.

There's not much to say about this book. I enjoyed it as a child and read the entire series. I liked it this time around. It's a quick read, very simple and gentle. The story is told from Jane's point-of-view and presents a child's eye view of the world. It's sweet and funny in some places. It's not quite as charming as The Melendy Family series but in the same style.",4,1.8,1.466,0.944

The concept was that Oliver is going to his first day of Kindergarten, but he is scared, so he picks up an alligator along the way to school. Anything that scares him, the alligator eats. This could've been a really cute book, but the alligator eating everything just made it creepy to me, and a little bit like ""let's all ignore our problems kiddies and they'll just go away (or rather be eaten by an alligator)"". The alligator eats everything, including Oliver's new teacher and all his classmates, but then Oliver realizes that he's kinda bored. It sounds like of cool things happening inside the alligator so he goes inside too and then he starts having fun. Recommended for ages 4-7, 3 stars.",3,0.917,-0.143,0.801

948,"When Russell signed up to compete on The Wild Life, he didn't count on being separated from his friends or being placed on a team with strangers! Still, his teammates Mari, Dev, and Sage quickly prove themselves to be great competitors as they enter the first leg of the contest - a race through the rain forest. With Mari's knowledge of wildlife, Sage's enthusiasm, and Dev's skill with technology, Russell feels certain they have a chance of winning. But what does Russell contribute to the team? And what should he do when he suspects his friends on the opposing team might be cheating? 
 This book panders to two causes that are very popular in the children's literature community right now - diversity, and STEM. Unfortunately, their inclusion in this book feels forced and inauthentic. Aside from the names of the characters, there is very little to differentiate them as members of their respective cultures, and indeed they sound like talking heads, not real people. The biological information about plants and animals that is injected between chapters does its best to look like a cool and interesting part of the book, but it is mostly dry informational text that could appear in a science textbook, and it is likely to be skimmed, or possibly skipped altogether. 
 The story itself definitely stands out as different. While the idea that elementary-aged kids would truly be set free to navigate the rain forest with only one chaperone to assist them is far-fetched, it does create a wonderful adventure story for young readers who are tired of reading the same home, school, and friendship stories over and over again. The idea of a kid being asked to compete against his closest friends also adds an interesting layer to the story, especially when it looks as though Russell's good friends are competing dishonestly. The moral dilemma Russell experiences gives the book something else to focus on during the down time between the more exciting plot points. 
 Race the Wild: Rain Forest Relay is a good alternative to books like Capture the Flag by Kate Messner, which might be too difficult or long for more reluctant or struggling readers. It also fills the great need for adventure stories for kids who are beyond beginning chapter books but not quite ready for novels. The writing could be a lot stronger - and a lot more interesting - but as pleasure reading this summer, it's likely to find an eager audience.",2,1.633,0.766,0.998

He's 11 now and still loves it. Whenever I read it to his younger brother, he comes over and listens. It's not exactly a Halloween book, but it's fun to read around this holiday. A witch flying on her broom crash's in Minna Shaw's garden when her broom suddenly losses power. Minna Shaw is kind and takes pity on the witch bringing her into her house to heal. After the witch heals she leaves her ""old"" broom behind. The broom turns out to still have a little life in it and soon becomes both a help and a companion to the widow. This does not set well with the widow's neighbor who believes the broom is evil. Eventually the widow and her broom live peacefully.

 While the story line was cute, there were words that seemed out of sync with the recommended ages of three to twelve, i.e. bolognese sauce. 
 This is about a vegetarian dragon named Alphonse who is challenged by his father to prepare a meal for the entire family. He searches his recipes & his memory to find something that they all would like. 
 The illustrations are well done. Because it did capture his attention when I read it to my favorite little boy, I gave it almost four stars.

Text introduces kids to the different systems of the body (skeletal, muscular, brain and nerves, lungs, heart and blood, stomach and intestines). Illustrations feature racially diverse kids engaging in all sorts of physical activity and suggested activities can be found in the back matter. 
 What I like about this book is that it teaches in a fun way and encourages activity rather than focusing on discouraging bad behaviors. Nothing is specifically outlawed, rather there's room for all in moderation (i.e TV/movies/video games balanced with running and fruits and veggies as snacks).

973,"My name is Will, and I am useless and pathetic. At least, that's all the alchemist ever calls me. He sends me on errands in the middle of the night, and the only positive part is when I pass the window of the girl in the attic. I imagine she'd be my friend if we ever met. One night, I mixed up the delivery of a box to the Lady Premiere, a huge mistake! I guess I gave her someone's cremated ashes instead of the most powerful magic ever seen. Oops! I barely escaped the alchemist's clutches and quickly hopped a train out of town. I kind of devised a plan during the following hours, but they quickly changed during a stop when I saw the girl from the attic walking outside the window! I finally met Liesl a few hours later, but I wasn't prepared for her ghostly friends. However, I didn't know it at the time, but Po and Bundle soon became the keys to saving our lives! 
 This book is one of those where seemingly separate series of events all come together in the end. Liesl's sole focus is on returning her father's ashes to the pond where her mother is buried. Will's focus is on staying alive and helping Liesl. The alchemist's focus is on pleasing the Lady Premiere by giving her the magic to raise spirits of the dead. Other random minor characters get mixed up in the events but become important in the unified resolution of the issues. Liesl maintains an innocence throughout the plot, as she's motivated by love. She tries to teach Po about friendship, things he's forgotten since his death. Po doesn't understand emotions but quickly trusts Liesl and wants to help her. His ability to travel between the living and the Other Side is important in helping Liesl. It's interesting that the author makes the ghosts' identities less defined. Po isn't a boy or girl, and Bundle isn't a dog or cat. This adds to the endearing confusion of these spirits.

 This is a perfect book for kids who like scary books that aren't really scary at all, but very funny and even a bit heartwarming. 
 The other Graves family book was a Halloween book, and in Union City, Michigan (the author's home town) there really is a Graves' family house and Polacco has a haunted house there every Halloween. This book takes place during the summer (yes, camping!) but has the ghoulishness often associated with Halloween. 
 I love the artwork, which is of a different style from that in many of Polacco's books.

The ghost agrees to find her glasses just so they can scare her, but once they find them for her she doesn't even get a chance to thank them because the sun comes up and the ghost vanishes! 
 In Short: This is a cute book for entertainment. It's very comical but doesn't teach anything. This could be a good book to cheer up kids who aren't happy about having to get their first pair of glasses. This could also be a fun bedtime story. 
 Pros: This book is well written, well translated, and should be easy for children to read. The art is really cute and funny. The story is quite comical.

995,"Double Dog Dare is the dual story of 4th Graders Kansas Bloom and Francine Halata. Kansas is new to school and was known in his former school as the ""King of Dares."" This moniker doesn't mean much until a spot opens up in Media Club for a new news anchor. Francine and Kansas tie for the coveted job. In an effort to break the tie Kansas and Francine embark on a Dare War--one point for each dare successfully accomplished and whoever earns the most dare points will become the new anchorperson for morning announcements. 
 Unknown to each other, both Kansas' and Francine's parents are going through a divorce. The premise is weak and the first several dares are lame in content and wholly uninteresting in the storytelling. The first 80 pages or so are bland and unremarkable. I almost put this book down without finishing it. I am glad that I didn't because the second half of the book came alive and finished at a decent pace. 
 The characters of Kansas and Francine both began to sound like real kids about a third of the way into the story. I became interested in their dares when the dares became secondary for both of them. It is at this point that they start interacting with each other and with their respective parents (and sister--in Kansas' case). This is the point at which I started to care about them as people. 
 Graff's older-age books such as the terrific The Thing About Georgie do not suffer from this clunky plot beginnings issue but her other young reader novel Sophie Simon Solves Them All For You (which I enjoyed AFTER the first few chapters) does. 
 The verdict on Double Dog Dare is that if young readers can hang in there through the first several dares, the pace and the plot pick up speed and energy, resulting in genuine complications, a few well-choreographed slapstick events and an authentic expression of kids' views and feelings in the midst of a divorce. The ending, while not spectacular, is ultimately satisfying. This could definitely be a worthwhile read for 3rd or 4th graders.",3,0.714,0.244,0.988
