I contacted Shop-Vac and they mailed me a new motor that I had to install myself.  I installed it, but it still couldn't pick up a toothpick.  I contacted Shop-Vac again.

13,"  We owned the original Sonicare for years and we loved it.  When we bought this model, we expected the same good performance we had from the original.  We were sorely disappointed by the fact that the screw on brush heads were flimsy and didn't screw down on the base unit securely.  We found the transfer of the ultra-sonic vibrations were dampened by the fact that the brush heads didn't remain tightly connected to the base unit.  After using this model for a year, we were receiving negative feedback from our dental hygienist.  We ended up buying another brand of electronic toothbrush but still weren't getting the results we expected.  Finally bought the Sonicare Flexcare model with snap on style heads.  This model works beautifully.  I would recommend you NOT buy Sonicare products with screw on style brush heads as they continuously loosen themselves from the base unit which degrades their performance.  The snap on style heads available on some Sonicare models remain securely attached to the base unit and therefore, transfer the ultrasonic vibrations to the brush head and your teeth more effectively.",1,0.175,-0.333,0.931

Turned it on and started cleaning up, and when time to turn it off the switch would not work! try and try and the thing would not turn off. So I unplugged it from the wall. The reason this is a big deal is when someone pays close to 100 dollars for a product it should last more than six months, and the other reason is when I plug it back in or unplug it there are sparks at least half inch long coming from the outlet. This not only will hurt someone, but will make the outlet in the house no good either. As far as care goes it is well maintained. Bag change and belt (which it doesn't need one because it never worked long enough). Is this worth 90 dollars, NO. If you take the top off to look at the motor and power switch its held together by cardboard. And the switch is cheap plastic so no wonder why it quit working. Checked to see if there is a replacement switch, and guess what, Eureka has discontinued the belts and Bags, and no power switch.  So to bring this to a end, the 20ft power cord is short, the bag beings to smell after while, all plastic, switch fails, all this thing has for it is power.

Absolutely useless for anything that needs to carry any current (even 1 amp and your voltage is already 1.6 V less than is was at the source by the time you lose .8 V on each end). For resistance measurement they add a total of 1.6 ohms to the total measurement if used to connect something to the meter. They are only good for measuring voltage with the tiny measurement current that a meter uses for that. If you use them anywhere else in a circuit keep in mind that you just added a .8 ohm resistor whether you wanted one or not.nnConclusion: not worth the cheap price.

I used it for both on my hardwood floors and it simply did not have the weight/power to do the job. It could spread the wax on the floor, however it did a poor job of buffing out the floors.nWithin twenty minutes of use, the U bar on the handle bent and this disabled the unit to turn off without unplugging.n The felt pads that came with the unit were flimsy and popped off the unit when in use.n I could smell the unit overheat after about the first ten minutes- this makes me wonder how long it is going to last.n Overall:nIf you have small floor cleaning jobs using standard floor cleaners, it can do the job, at least for a while.

The problem is that any bag that actually fits this unit is designed for low-rise vacuums, not this tall type.

The other problem is that there is no bag actually designed to reach the bottom of the vacuum, so that as the bag fills up, it ends up hanging on the inlet causing pressure on the paper and eventually ripping open blowing all the debrisdust all over the place. Those disposable wrap around paper filters that go over the foam sleeve clog up way too fast. Another problem is that housing just below the motor that is supposed to hold the foam sleeve directly interferes with the inlet leaving no room even if there was a tall bag that could reach the bottom of the vacuum offering support as debris collects and not putting pressure on the bag opening.

It does a fair job of moving more air into the room, but there's a couple of issues: 1) the electrical leads are very short, which means that you either put the junction box very close to the fan, or you add another section of wire; and 2) it is loud: I installed about 10 feet from the vent, and supported it via some soft material between it and the support we put in for it, and used duct tape to seal it, and although it is quiet in the basement when standing right underneath of it, it is fairly loud in the room itself, and not just extra wind noise, there's a hum to it.

590,"  I had some damage to woodwork in my home done by a couple of Gorillas delivering furniture. They actually broke chunks out of my custom made woodworking. I used this to repair it and it did a reasonable job. I have to tell you that you should use it as thinly as possible as it does tend to swell and foam. It did a good job but it is a big bottle and what you don't use will age and not be very good the next time you get out the bottle. The glue isn't clear and it looks yellow after it cures.nnMy suggestion is to use the right glue for the job. There are better wood glues out there that are easier to use and to clean up.

656,"  I recently engaged in a nutrition and workout program with an aim a reducing body fat and gaining muscle.  The best way to know if you are making progress is by monitoring your body fat.  While there are many expensive methods for determining your body fat, utilization of calibers are the cheapest method with some level of accuracy.

Just press the trigger which opens the jaws then place the calipers in position and release the trigger.  The spring will provide the appropriate force while you read the measurement.  Some measurements will require the use of another person (like triceps and back) to perform the measurements.  The small numbers can be hard to read if you are doing the measurement yourself.nnThe calipers are made of plastic but appear to be pretty durable (I dropped them a couple of times on the tile floor while taking measurements).nnOverall, and excellent product and does the job, just wish the numbers were a little bigger.",4,0.333,0.818,0.971

681,"  Note - I'm putting the bulk of this review on the 3D TerraLUX conversion as well, as I purchased that kit, too.nnI've had my 4D Maglite for over 10 years, and I've always considered it to be a good, but not great flashlight.  I have a couple tactical Surefire flashlights and a Pelican flashlight that I use as a firefighter that are all MUCH brighter than even the best Maglite.  However, the Surefires were both over $100 each, and they both use very expensive lithium CR123A batteries that do not last very long, which is a major drawback.  The Pelican was also extremely expensive, but it was purpose-built for firefighting and HAZMAT incidents.  It has decent battery life, and it does use standard C batteries, which is nice.nnSo, taking all that into account, I rarely use the Surefires except for tactical purposes, and I use the Pelican when I need a bright flashlight.  When I need a standard issue, not very expensive flashlight for general purposes, I grab one of my 4 Maglites, and if I need the flashlight to be on for a while, I grab the 4D one.nnI recently had an opportunity to mess around with one of the 2D Maglite LED flashlights.  From things I've seen on the internet, it was a 3rd Generation LED, with a square green base supporting the actual LED and a rating of 134 lumens.  This thing was a GREAT flashlight.  I was utterly stunned at the brightness of the light and the distance at which I could clearly see objects illuminated (250 yards plus).  This thing was brighter than my Surefires with brand new batteries.  I was also amazed at how well I could focus the beam, and how concentrated it stayed, even at great distances (something I cannot do with my Surefires).nnSo, I decided to see if I could find a conversion kit to change my current crop of Maglites over to the much brighter LED format.  These TerraLUX kits seemed to be the only real option.  They make multiple sizes to cover all my various Maglites - 2AA, 2D, 3D, 4D (Yes, I have a flashlight problem), and they had pretty good ratings and reviews on Amazon.nnAs soon as I got them I switched out my standard bulbs for the LEDs.  The switch couldn't have been any easier - Just unscrew the lens, unscrew a collar, pull out the old bulb and put in the LED.  No problems at all with installation.  I turned the flashlight on and I was pretty impressed with the improved brightness over the standard bulb.  It was DEFINITELY brighter, no doubt about it.  However, when compared to the 2D factory-made Maglite LED flashlight, it was noticeably not as bright, and it was not as bright as my Surefires, either.  The distance at which object were clearly illuminated was probably 150 yards - nothing to be disappointed with, but not nearly the distance of the factory Maglite LED.  I was really hoping that the TerraLUX conversion and the factory Maglite LED would be exactly the same, but unfortunately, they are not.  There is simply no way that the advertised 140 lumens of this conversion is correct.  My utterly unscientific and know-nothing guess would be that it's maybe 100-110 lumens.nnSo, to sum up - yes, this is an improvement over the standard Maglite bulb.  It is brighter, extremely easy to install, LEDs supposedly last forever, and they greatly improve battery life.  However, if you are hoping to turn your older Maglites into something as powerful as the new Maglite LEDs, you will be disappointed.nnDo I recommend the TerraLUX conversions?  Yes.  They will take your good Maglites and put them somewhere between good and great.  But, be aware that you will not get anywhere near 140 lumens, and your friends with true Maglite LEDs will probably make fun of you for having a flashlight that is not as bright as theirs.",4,0.244,0.564,0.999

The limited space means that upgrading the heat sink or increasing ventilation is out of the picture.  With the thermal paste that came with the computer, I would consistently overheat if the processor used its built in turbo boost, and sometimes even when the processor was limited to its default processing frequency.  This paste drastically reduced temperature buildup, so much so that I can overclock to very high levels and still keep 15-20C under my hardware's max temp, even under heavy load.  Only drawback to this product is the rather long break in period.  The manual says it requires 200 hr. to achieve full effectiveness, but it only took roughly 60 hr. for me to bring my temperature into acceptable range while overclocking both my CPU and GPU.

Just so i'm so bored and I told myself its useless that I bought this, i disassembled my laptop Gateway P-7805u and replaced the original thermal compound with this AS5.

995,"  Bought these for use around the garden.  For spraying weeds, these can't be beat.  The nozzles are adjustable, ranging from a fine, broad mist all the way to a straight, strong stream.  I walked around the yard spraying weeds, and quickly learned to use the straight setting and aim well, and I didn't have to bend over any more to hit the weeds dead-on.  Also, I used a black Sharpie to label the containers, and even though they get wet all the time, it has not rubbed off or smeared.  If you tighten the cap firmly by hand, it won't leak from the top.  Great product and value.",5,0.286,-0.091,0.966
