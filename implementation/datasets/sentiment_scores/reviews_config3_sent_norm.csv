"" are voice directly at the child. ultimate this i the problem i have with the book. i can't imagine ever say anything like this to my kid and it real bother me to think about other kid out there in the world who are treat this way. in samuel jackson's introduction to the audiobook he talk about raise hi daughter "" i did say ' go the fuck to sleep ' to h a lot.

[ side note: i have a little story about this, but i will save it for the end, since it real ha no place in this view... ] i find it so refresh and so much more powerful when an author just write, just tell the story that need to be told, and trust their audience to understand it. anne ursu doe just this. ursu doe not pander to h audience or hide from less pleasant aspect. h story i non - flinching and not necessarily go to have a happy end. no magic wand i ever go to be wave. there are a lot of villain in the world, and they come in all size, but there i no big bad villain, just time. ursu tell a story that i think will be embrace by children - who will respect it without even realize they are do so, or why - and will be enjoy by adult - who will find there i more in it that they would have imagine they'd get from a middle grade novel. there i a depth of pain to the story that i found real affect; i didn't expect it to have such a range of experience and emote. i don't want to turn anyone off by say this, because it i not like it some sob story written with the intent of make you cry.
