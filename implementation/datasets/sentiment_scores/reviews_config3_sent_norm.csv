( i guess aogg i, too, but their order i important for character develop - of which there i very little in this book. ) certain there nothing here trascendent enough to justify the enormous suspense of belief that some of the event quire. the worst the ( spoil - cut for spoil and also foul language ): * davy and goddamn dora. the moment their name were mention i groan. they are cousin olivers, obv; they serve no purpose in a book which could easily have focus on children anyway ( anne's pupil ); but beyond that they just don't make sense. why, why, would anne and marilla be the one to take these children?! i know marilla ha a deep felt sense of duty, but sure someone else could have been found at about the same level of distance from the mother ( marilla's third cousin ) whose household ha more expend source, or at least parent - age adult. we are talk, here, about a woman who must be about 70 and near blind, and a 16 - year - old in h first year of an emotional demand full - time adult job. not to mention, the whole reason anne stay home to teach was because marilla didn't feel she could manage on h own, financial or heal - wise - and that was when it was just a child - free house and farm to manage. if marilla had any extra energy, money, or time to spare, anne would have gone to college. nothing appear to have change since that decision. under these circumstance, how can she and anne possibly justify taking on the care of six - year - old twin??! cat, maybe, but not children. * with that said, i am not sure who i taking care of these kid real, because it seem like anne and marilla pretty much go about their day a if they don't exist / can be left home alone with no problem. anne work full time, goes visit, start a town beautify club, study, and pretty much never seem to be overwhelm or strapped for time. half the time when she get home, marilla ha dash down the street to mrs lynde's or gone on errand or something. the twin might a well be cat. ( hey, that would make a lot more sense. maybe anne's imagination i so vivid that all those conversation with davy are just h impression of what such a mischievous cat would be like a a human child? ) * wouldn't six - year - olds whose mom just die be, you know, sad? ( again, taken care of by "" they are cat "" theory. ) * i think davy i suppose to resemble anne in that he i mischievous, but ( a ) anne wasn't real mischievous so much a forgetful with poor judgment but overall good intention, and ( b ) davy isn't so much mischievous a actual malevolent. he legit try to hurt hi sister on numerous occasion. there i a difference * one final the about the twin: why even bother writ them to be twin?! dora i a complete non - character. she i suppose to be the "" good child "" opposite to davy, i suppose, but she i so silent, docile, and emotionless that i am complete creeped out by h and feel like she must be secret plotting to burn it all down. there i something wrong with that child. but also, dude, l. m., you made this whole the up, if you didn't want to write a "" good girl "" twin, you didn't have to! the twin concept add nothing and in fact the situate would be marginal less sane if davy were a lone individual child. i can almost, almost see anne and marilla feel that they can take in one child temporarily howmuchtroublecanhebe ( cue laugh track ). the fact that anne and marilla keep talk about they love davy more i ice on the cake. maybe try to actual talk to dora? maybe g h 1 / 2 of 1 % of the attention you are give to davy, and gave to anne? she not a squeaky wheel but i do not think she i do okay. * new topic: paul irving. paul fuck irving. he suppose to be anne 2.0 but, lack any of h fault, he just come off a an implausible fairy - boy not to mention kind of a smarmy ass. like, when anne talk about the star bee god daisy chain or whatever, you can forge h sound dopey because you know it genuine cup - runneth - over joie de vivre + lack of impulse control. paul i much more compose and so hi muse come off a more self - consciously twee and self - satisfy. i want to smack that "" you know, teach "" right off hi smug face. * oh, and "" my little mother "" don't get me start * i'm with levi boulter, the avonlea village improve society sound like a bunch of jerk * the storm had a lot of buildup but didn't actual have any impact on the plot * the close we get to a climax i the union of stephen irving and lavendar lewis, but it happen offscreen and doesn't even involve any of the character except indirect. in some way i feel like it appropriate thematically for this almost dreamlike interlude in anne's life to have a sense of fairy - tale wonder ( especial when the event can also be prosaically explain, a marilla delightful doe ), and that house sound fuck boss. but i it too much to ask to finish on something that actual involve anne a a principal character? she ha some good character moment ear on when she realize that some of h teach ideal are realistic in the face of actual children, but a the book goes on, this most fall by the wayside for side plot involve new character we don't care about. * overall this book just feel more... i don't know... obvious than green gable. like it fan fiction for itself, or something. green gable was sentimental, but it wasn't sappy; the character develop was consistent and gradual; the character felt ground and likeable. in this book the new character just feel like vice, like concept instead of people; and the old character don't fully feel like themselves. the emotional moment rang false for me - they felt earned due to either lack of tense / buildup or just lack of car about the character involve. all around, a snooze, made the more appoint because i know how good l. m. montgomery can be, and because there are occasional flash of the brilliance: in the vivid way she scribe the and the nature appreciate and a few of the event. she still h, she just got the formula all wrong in this one. * not enough gilbert",1,0.057,0.075,0.998

( and i mean at the end of the day - the entire quest take them a day and a half to achieve. ) meanwhile, other preserve & sanctuary are fall left, right, & centre, and it just through the divine save power of seth that any preserve / sanctuary / world are still stand. the entire premise for the plot was terrible: if marat & agad can't figure out why the defences at blackwell keep are shaky, then why didn't they go ask the ' fair folk ' and the somber knight? if they couldn't go because they were dragon and they thought they wouldn't be aid, why not have kendra and seth be the one to go cover such information - instead of make them caretaker of blackwell keep?? it just seem like way too much of a stretch for me that all the adult in this book would have absolute no one to turn to except two ear teenaged kid. seth i off in this book. read through the original series, hi character grow the most; by the time you finish key to the demon prison, seth ha gone through a lot of real awful stuff and live to tell the tale. but in this book, he seem to have regress a little: whereas in previous book he goad centaur and similar creature in an attempt to get other rile up enough to actual pitch in and do their bit, in this book he just whiny and bee rude, point blank. and the scene where they meet the k of the ' fair folk ' annoy me - just because you make your character point out that no one i give them information and just bee cryptic for no reason, doesn't mean you get away with make your character cryptic a the author. just g u the information we need instead of shuttle u off one department to another to get the simple bit of info we need to save the day. seth isn't just useless poke at people, he also taking much more careless risk, but those risk of course tie to the whole grand save - the - day bit at the end. before, he was a bit ignorant of how the magical world work, and could be justify in getting misled by satyr, demon, whathaveyou, but now he just off do whatever for a bit of gold instead of actual adventure like he use to. grand sorenson and blank slate kendra still don't like anything he doe or trust him to make a single intelligent decision, even aft all they've been through, though now, ironical enough, he actual act like the brat they've been say he was. i wish mull would let everyone grow up a bit and make good decisions together instead of rely on the same plot vice that he did in the prior series - grandpa sorenson either say no or would definite say no, seth doe it anyway because he the on character with a brain in the book, everything work out perfect, world i save, grandparent and kendra are appall that seth did what he did, glad that the world i save but are still go to reprimand him for do anything. the same plot i in mote here, on slight change at the end because no one active reprimand him - instead ask seth if he feel he need a punish for act out. geez guy. the last two or three chapter are the b in the entire book. i wish the entire book had felt that excite. it wasn't the most excite the ever, but it felt like something was actual happen, and i real enjoy it. and yay more inn dialogue about how hot guy are from kendra's perspective. she already set on h ancient unicorn - the book hon to god say bracken i h ' one and on ' - but she ogle all the dude and blush over the prince in the kingdom of the fair folk. given the sup - obvious mention of the f crown near the beginning, i guess we should be expect the queen of ogre to make an appearance at some point in this series, have been introduce to all the re of rule. i real wish i could look forward to that; hopeful the next instalments in this series will be a little more interesting a he get the overarching plot more to gear. i was also wonder who had taken over the position of caretaker at live mirage. agad was go to be at the end of the last book in the original series, but now agad i off to soar cliff in this book. all the grandparent are account for and present at fablehaven, the sorenson set accompany kendra and seth to blackwell keep, and all the other character we know are off on other assignment. so who was set up there? overall, yeah, it was ok. which i kind of a let down. i expect better. hopeful we'll get better from mull over the course of this series.",2,0.094,0.081,0.998
