14,"it i a brilliant effective form chamber, but it i a brilliant effect vise chamber. i forbore to stand to catch your eye early, mrs. heal, because i want to list to the hon member for chichester and the right hon and learn member for sleaford and north hykeham cuss their amendment and new clause. i shall maintain the spirit of consensus that ha predominate in this bate, but not because i believe for one moment in the concept of appoint term pee or non - term pee. i am wholly against that concept. a most hon member know, i have always argue in favour of an elect second chamber, but the amend ha some merit in the text - and on in the text - of an reformed house and how we might limit some of the more deleterious aspect of it form and function at the moment. one the that i have notice about those who are elevate to another place i that they tend very quick to believe that the process by which they were elevate must be extreme wise and sensible given the outcome, which i that they are now a member of that house. the longer they stay in the house, the more they are convince of that fact and the less likely they are to change. the merit of what the hon member for chichester ha pose i that it provide an envelope for that patronage to end. that must be right. it limit, at least to a certain extent, the effect of prime ministerial patronage. i also think that it would have the function of focus those who were in that house for a limit period on the job that they were there to do. a great numb of life pee, particular those who have been recent create, seem to have on the hazy view of their function a member of a legislature, a evidence by the fact that they rare attend. when they do attend, it i usual on a matte that directly affect them rather than because they have any view of their function in a work democracy. the fact i that the work of the other house i carry out by a very limit numb of people. all credit to those who shoulder the burden - they do a terrific job - but the fact i that many member of the other house are rare seen and rare tribute. precise so. it irritate me enormous when someone ha the perk and honours associate with membership of the other house but doe not do the work involve. it i sad to say that a lot of them do that. we might feel that some member of this house, on occasion, tribute relative little, but at least they occasional turn up to vote. some in the other place do not even find that that i a necessary part of their function. a i said, i think that term limit might focus the view of those who receive such prefer on the role that they are expect to perform. my on quibble, which was mention by the hon member for chichester, i the time period for which they might be expect to serve. he mention three parliament. i would be happy with that if we had fix - term parliament, but we do not. have a specific time might be better than express it in term of parliament, because there would not be a direct relationship between the peer activities in the other house and election to this house. however, i am a strong advocate of a fix - term parliament in any case, which would solve that difficulty. i have to say that i do not agree with the argument made by the right hon and learn member for sleaford and north hykeham in favour of appoint. there i a considerable benefit in not have reappointments, large for the reason he enlist in favour of some of the the that he said - that i, dependence. when people know that there i nothing to be gain by act positive to the prospect of future advance or patronage, they have an dependence of mind that might not be quite a strong in other circumstance. if we have a fix term without the possibility of appoint, that free anybody who i in that position from the sometime adverse attentions of the whip or party colleague. they will clear be free to speak their own mind. an interesting and important point mention by the right hon and learn gentleman at the end of hi comment and pick up on by the hon member for forest of an i the position of minister. i take a view, which i not share by everybody, that we should not have minister appoint from the house of lord anyway. minister should come from this place and should go along to the house of lord to argue their case for particular legislate and we should move yet another ti of patronage. however, that i not the position at the moment. i accept your guidance, mrs. heal. on term limit for minister appoint a minister to the other place, i think that there i a very strong argument - we dealt with this in our cross - party discussion on the future of the house of lord - that, if someone i appoint a a minister, the term should be for the duration of their role in the administrate. there i no argument for it come automatically with a permanent seat or even a 15 - year seat or whatever in the house of lord. it should be an ad hoc position, if it i our view that minister should continue to be appoint from that house. entry to the house should be for the duration of the time for which that person i a minister. if there i then an argument that the person involve ha perform distinguish service, perhaps in the role of secretary of state, and merit a term peerage, so be it. their appoint should not be a qualify from a term peerage, but it should not automatically be assume that because someone ha been an under - secretary for a few week that person merit a permanent place in the vise chamber of our legislature. that seem to me to be an answerable argument. i would have preferred it if this amend had include a section on minister, but i appreciate the fact that we are talk about a principle. it i a principle on which we will divide, if the hon member for chichester press hi amend to a division. i shall commend to my right hon and hon friend that the amend should be support. i shall not do so, however, because i think that it i a perfect amend or that a form house of lord with term pee in it would be a form house of lord. it would be just slight better than what we have at the moment and i suppose that any advance i better than none. on a point of order, sir michael. can i be clear about this? we may have agree to deal with clause 30 and 31 and schedule 4 in the same bate, but i do not think we agree to deal with clause 32, and it seem a though the minister might be stray to a discussion of clause 32. i think that there are limit a to how much we can reorganise the agree programme. the hon gentleman i correct. we are deal, at most, with clause 31, and it would be a good idea if we did not, at this point, stray to clause 32, a that deal with resignation from the house of lord, which i a separate matte. i have two quick question for the minister. one i about offences that are committed outside the uk and for which sentence are given and serve outside the uk. i understand why the relevant vision i in the bill and do not argue with it, and i note the capacity in schedule 4 for a solute to be passe effective to annul the result of a find of guilt in a foreign jurisdiction. however, i hope that the minister will consider whether there should be some notion of dual criminality, so that to be cover, the action must be an offence in the uk a well a in the other jurisdiction. it seem surprise that a person found guilty of some suppose offence in another jurisdiction that i not an offence in the uk could come back here to find that their membership of the house of lord had been forfeit a a result, and that they had to wait for a solute of the house to have their position vindicate or otherwise. that i a slight long - winded way of deal with something that ought to be clear - cut. my other question - i hope that the minister i listen, despite hi conversation with you, sir michael. it i rather pointless my stand up and make comment on clause stand part if the minister i not listen to what i am say. i hope that he i. i hop that i had made myself clear, but just in case the minister did not get the full purport of what i was say, it was about the question of dual criminality. i was ask whether a so - call offence committed outside the uk that i not an offence here should be dealt with by automatic forfeiture of membership of the house of lord and then have to be overturn by a solute, or whether the bill should simply state that to qualify, it must be an offence both in the uk and in the foreign jurisdiction. that i what we often state in legislate deal with oversea jurisdiction. the second question that i wish to put to the minister i about clause 31, which i do not believe he mention specifically. it state: "" an expulsion solute or a suspense solute may contain other vision in addition to that mention in the subsection above. "" what i that "" other vision "" that the minister envisage? if stand order of the other place are to be made on the basis of the bill, the lord will want to know what that might entail. i would have thought that a simple suspense or expulsion solute would be appropriate, and that it would not be appropriate to add other the that member of another place might think appropriate punishment for whatever the perceive crime might be. from my experience of another place, they might be remarkably invent in find appropriate punishment to add to the charge list in a solute. will the minister therefore explain what that subsection mean? i appreciate that disproportionality of sentence would not be caught, and it i right that the house of lord should address that by solute, but it seem inappropriate that there should be any question of forfeiture for something that i not a crime in the unite kingdom. i was ask on that the minister consider that point and whether an amend could be table to deal with that circumstance.",1,0.211,0.138,0.999

32,"i concur with the point made by hon member from the minority party, because it i important that the whole house ha the opportunity to be represent on the committee. however, mote 3 state that "" no few than t "" of the nominator "" shall be member of the candidate party "". that may be an oversight, but perhaps the lead of the house can explain how it would be possible for member from the minority party or dependent member to be nominate. i am sure that the intention i not to exclude them, but that word might need mr speak to interpret it flexibly when it came to nomination. a this i the first time i have spoken while you have been in the chair, madam deputy speak, i take the opportunity to congratulate you on your new position. i am light to follow the hon member for north east derbyshire, who made a powerful and convince case in favour of transparency in relate to the back - bench busy committee, which i wholehearted endorse. i endorse also what she said about three former member: tony wright, evan harris and mark fish, who did so much to campaign for the committee and to bring it to fruition. i am somewhat appoint that we are cuss this today. the reason for my appoint i that, in the previous parliament, on 4 march, the house passe a mote say that it look forward to the house bee offer the opportunity "" to establish, in time for the start of the next parliament, a backbench busy committee "". we are several week to the new parliament. fortunate, that was not done in time for the start of this parliament. that was despite assurance from the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham, who said: "" i can assure the house that we will bring forward the stand order, and there will be an opportunity for the house to endorse them before the next election. "" - she also said: "" i am under a duty and a responsibility to ensure that this happen before the next parliament "". - fortunate, that did not happen, which i a great tragedy, but perhaps it should also serve a a salutary lesson for those of u in this house who are keen to see form progress in general - i suspect that that i most of the member present in the chamber - that there i not always an easy pa to form. it i therefore important that those of u who are form - mind make sure we continue to campaign, rather than assume that everything will be fine just because the house ha agree to a mote on something or other. i am, however, absolute light that the lead of the house and my hon friend the deputy lead of the house have introduce these mote so speedily in the new parliament, and i think that goes some way toward make amend for the house's ability to get the done before dissolute. i am especial please to see my hon friend in hi new post; he was made for it, a he ha always been a staunch fend of parliament, and, indeed, of back benchers. i know that all of u who are eager for form to happen take great comfort from knowing that the lead of the house and the deputy lead of the house are also very much form - mind. in term of control of the busy of the house, the proposal are indeed an historic transfer of power from the govern to back benchers. the new govern are passionate about decentralisation, and perhaps that decentralisation i start at home. my comment will be high support of the lead and deputy leader effort to make progress with form, but i also want to tease out some issue that could be improve upon still further. it i clear excellent that the back - bench busy committee will now be set up a a result of the mote laid before the house today, but there i still a slight concern about the numb of day allocate, a i raise in busy question last week. the wright port suggest 35 day for back - bench busy. i understand that the lead and deputy leader motivation for splitting the 35 day between this house and westminster hall i to enable proper scrutiny of legislate by allocate additional day to the port stage of bill. it ha been a valid criticism of how bill have progress that they have not receive proper scrutiny on port and entire swath of bill have been left undiscussed on the floor of the house. i understand the motivation, therefore, but i very much hope that at least amend to mote 4, which would insert a reference to 27 day to stand order no. 14, will be accept. that would certain go some way toward give assurance. i am very please that that i the case. there i another issue i wish to raise, and which i hope my hon friend the deputy lead will be able to address in hi wind - up speech. i appreciate that these measure are about move toward wright rather than about the wright form bee implement all in one go, so in respect of this agree that there will be 27 day of back - bench busy in the chamber, will there also be a move toward crease the numb of day from 27 in the future? i hope my hon friend will be able to say something posit about that, a that would be very helpful. obvious, we are at the very beginning of a new parliament with a new govern so the legislate programme i heavy, but perhaps a the parliament continue there might be additional time on the floor of the house for back - bench busy. it i also worth look at the innovate use of time to create room for back - bench busy. for stance, tuesday morn and wednesday even have already been mention in reference to private member busy. the next issue i want to raise in respect of the back - bench busy committee i to do with permanence. it ha been suggest that it member should be re - elect every year, and that there should be a view of it progress and how well it i work in a year time. in some way, that sound very good. a a democrat, i like election; and a somebody who like to learn how we can do the better, a view might sound like a good idea. taken together, however, these proposal cause a certain amount of concern, and there i a genuine dang that such a view might be use to try to get rid of the back - bench busy committee, and that if the committee were seen a bee too effect, annual election might be use a an opportunity for the whip to move a particular effect chair. one issue of pertinence in that regard i who will vote for the committee member. if the govern in effect have a block vote of more than 100 mps, it will become very difficult for any candidate who i not support by the govern to become the chair of the committee. we recent elect the chair of select committee and the convention a original commend by the procedure committee was that minister and parliamentary private secretary of the relevant department would not vote in the election of the departmental select committee chair. although this was not made explicit in the wright port, i wonder whether it may be possible for the govern to take the same self - deny ordinance in vote for member of the back - bench busy committee and it chair. it doe not seem reasonable for the back - bench busy committee, which represent back benchers, to be elect by back benchers. if that can be done, it might assuage some of the concerns about annual election. i also want to press my hon friend the deputy lead about the same issue on which i intervene on the lead of the house: mote 3. that i not on about the chair of the back - bench busy committee; it i about any candidate to become a member of the committee. it clear state that of the candidate nomination, "" no few than t shall be member of the candidate party "". that would exclude member of the scottish national party, plaid cymru, the other minority party and, indeed, dependent candidate. i great appreciate that intervention from my hon friend, and that assurance. i am sure that this can be solve. the speak certain seem to be given a lot of power in these election a almost a de facto turn office, so i suspect a solute can be found. i shall now turn to the issue of private members' bill and the two amendment in my name: amend to mote 2 and amend to mote 4. i want to share with the house why i think this i an important issue, although i also appreciate that some new member are present and i do not wish to scare them or put them off. i just want to scribe my experience of the horror of friday sitting. one of the first friday sitting i attend dealt with a private member's bill sponsor by the hon member for edinburgh north and leith. hi bill was on climate change and i was keen to support it, and many of my constituent were also keen for me to do so. the second bill on the order paper was about the manage of energy in build, and we thought that because there would be f hour of busy in the chamber, we might be able to get one second read finish and have another one well under way. we had not count, however, on a two - hour speech from one member, and then another member stand up to try to make a speech of a similar length. in order to get a private member's bill passe, there need to be 100 mps for the closure vote, so there were doz of mps in the chamber who had come along to support this private member's bill. indeed, some of them want to make some comment on the cord, perhaps through an intervention, but had we all done that, the bill would have been talk out, and all because one or two member were bee, frank, quite rude about use up time to talk it out. i member sitting in the chamber and think that if i want the bill to go through, i would just have to be quiet and say nothing - and not even say that i support the bill. i accept that but, along with many other new member at the time, i left the chamber appall and furious that this was the way we did our busy, and i thought that it absolute had to change. i also member that when i spoke to member who had been in the house for longer than me, it was clear that they had got use to the a they said, "" well, that the way it i. "" i thought to myself that i never want to accept that such a ridiculous way of work i the way it had to be. i suspect that current new mps would be equal appall if that happen, but i am sure that there will be an opportunity to make a change, because there need to be one. i agree absolute with the hon gentleman, and i think that the amend stand in the name of the hon member for wellingborough i sensible. a he outline, it just deal with the fair allocate of the equivalent of 13 day p year - or 26 day over two year. my amendment would also allow the back - bench busy committee to programme the remain stage of private members' bill, so that once a bill had receive it second read a timetable mote could be table and, thus, the ability of member to talk out the bill would be move at that stage. although i think that that ability should be gone from the beginning of proceed on such bill, and that people who wish to defeat them should do so on the merit of the argument and through a vote of this house, my amendment would be a good step in the right direction. make a change on the ability to programme private members' bill would be helpful. i was please to hear the chair of the procedure committee say that hi committee will examine this issue more wide, because i accept that my amend and that of the hon member for wellingborough deal on with small part of the problem and that the issue of private members' bill and friday sitting need to be examine much more in the round and more general. i urge that such a port should be conduct quick and act on soon, so that we do not lose the momentum for form. we do not want there to be an excuse to kick these issue to the long grass. i hope that if we do get some good commendation, the demoralising and soul - destroy experience that many mps have sat through on frustrate fridays will be a the of the past. i was please to hear that mote 13 i not go to be move this even, because that mote i one of the b argument against leave the to the usual channel that i have come across in a long time. expand three select committee to 16 member was a very elegant solute, and the fact that it was cook up by the whip without even consult the chair of those committee beggar belief. the wright port made it clear that 11 should be the maximum numb of member on a select committee, but we face a genuine problem in ensure that the minority party are represent. there are different way of solve that difficulty. in the previous parliament, when the liberal democrat were in opposite, we made sure that some of the place that we were allocate went to the minority party. i know that that certain happen from time to time on committee such a those cuss statutory instrument. one solute might, thus, be for labour to be similar generous. another solute might be to add one minority party representative to these committee, rather than for them to have an additional four member also. if necessary, in order to maintain the govern - opposite balance, perhaps we could add a govern member, but the argument for add f extra people to select committee do not stand up. i am please that the govern have listen on this issue and are go away to find a better solute - it i important that a solute i found. in conclusion, when we examine the issue in the spirit of the wright port we also need not to forget that further form i require; radical and excite a today form are, this process should not stop here. the "" involve the public "" section of the wright port contain a lot of good idea, but much further work need to be done, particular on petition and the online engagement of this place. good idea come from, and reform can be found in, all part of this house, and on issue such a these we have been practising the new politic for a very long time in our cross - party work. with the lead and the deputy lead both bee so positive pose to form, i, for one, am optimistic that most of the mote on today order paper will constitute an important next step in the vital form of this house. given the assurance about private members' bill that we have heard from my hon friend and from the chair of the procedure committee, i will not press amend to mote 4 to a division. however, my hon friend ha not answer my question about whether minister will vote on the membership of the back - bench busy committee, or whether they will follow the self - deny ordinance that apply to election for select committee chair.",0,0.223,0.409,1

110,"this ha been a passionate bate. although i am able to accept new clause 11 on behalf of the govern, i admire the integrity, commitment and, a other have said, the parliamentary ingenuity, of my hon friend the member for wellingborough. a befit somebody who i assiduous in hi attendance and fierce in hi affection for, and loyalty to, the house of commons a an institute, he ha gone through the rule book and explore parliamentary procedure to ensure that an issue about which he care so strong ha ample time for bate on the floor of the committee. i want to do my hon friend justice by respond in tail on hi proposal on it merit. the difficulty i not simply that new clause 11 seek to do something that i not within the scope of the bill a the govern have frame it, but that it raise a numb of important political question. i qualify my state, m primarolo, by say, "" a the govern have frame the bill "". the tend purpose of the bill i to provide both additional parliamentary scrutiny and the ultimate sanction of a public referendum on decisions that would transfer power and competences from this country to the eu. the government purpose was not to provide for the sort of additional referendum that my hon friend the member for wellingborough seek. it i indeed a tribute to hi parliamentary skill that he ha found a way, within order, to seek to address that issue. good say, minister. the pose new clause i in order. whether the govern actual like it or think that it should be in the bill i the purpose of this bate. i think we have clarify that now. i am perfect happy to abide by your rule on that, m primarolo. assume that the bill gain parliamentary approval and royal assent in the normal way, it will apply during this parliament from the time when it come to effect. a i said early today, one illustrate of that i that the treaty change pose by germany and bee taken through eu institute at the moment will have to be ratify by primary legislate rather than simply by a solute of both house, a would be the case under the current legislate, which was introduce by the previous govern in 2008. what distinguish this parliament i that the govern have said, a part of their coalition agree, that we do not tend to agree at european level to any proposal to amend the treaty or invoke passarelle clause that would quire a referendum under the term of the legislate that we have been bate for a numb of day now. the referendum authorised under the bill are tend to be final decisions. they will g people the opportunity to judge whether a particular proposal to g new power to the european ion i in the national interest. one of the the that i trouble about the new clause i that it implicit assume that those who vote no to a particular position also want to challenge the uk's membership of the eu, but i do not think that that can be taken for grant. a other hon member have said, there i a risk that some people could be influence in how they vote on the substance of a proposal by a calculate of whether it would be likely to produce the end result of an in / out referendum. such elector might take to account hi or h view on the in / out proposal and not just the pro and con of the measure on which they are bee invite to cast a vote. i think that my hon friend the member for wellingborough overlook the problem of a possible succession of referendum on britain's membership of the eu. it i possible to imagine that under a future govern - not this one - referendum on move to qualify majority vote for common foreign and security policy and on join the euro might be schedule for two success year. the new clause would leave open the possibility of an in / out referendum aft one - or, indeed, both - of those referendum, because under hi new clause a rejection of the first position would trigger an in / out referendum, which might result in the public decide to stay in the eu. a second referendum on a treaty change might come forward 12 months late and also be reject, and then, in the course of less than a year, we would find ourselves with two success referendum on the uk's membership of the eu. that i not a sensible way in which to duct our relationship with the country of the eu. nor doe the new clause address what would happen if there were two question on a ballot paper in one day, which we bate early. why should a posit vote for one treaty change position and a negate vote for a second trigger a referendum? one cannot read to how people cast their vote on treaty change proposal what their view would be of the desirability of a referendum on membership. more fundamental, however, the new clause doe not capture the range of opine held by the british people. the hon member for vauxhall, whom i complete respect on these matte, said that she want people to be able to express a view on the direction that the eu was taking. however, that i not what people are bee offer through the new clause, of course. they are bee offer the opportunity not to express their view on the direction of the eu, but to say whether the uk should remain a member. withdrawing from the european ion i not the on choice for people who are satisfy with the current arrangement. there are plenty of people around who want britain to remain a member of the european ion, but to have certain power current exercise in brussels repatriate to this country. aft all, that was the combination of view express at the last general election in the conservative party manifesto, which sought the repatriate of certain power, but said: "" a conservative govern will play an act and energetic role in the european ion "". my hon friend the member for north east somerset made a strong point when he said that one of the advantage of the new clause was that it could weak the chance of make stick under future government of a different political colour the new arrangement for a referendum on any transfer of competence and power to brussels. it i very much part of this government intention that the arrangement embody in the bill should become a settle and general accept part of our constitutional order. no parliament or govern can guarantee that any piece of legislate that they bring forward will be immune from amend or peal by a future parliament. however, just a the previous, labour government devolution legislate, which was vigorous oppose by my party at the time, ha now become accept across the house and i something that my right hon friend the prime minister endorse and ha frequent declare he i intent on make work better, so, i would argue, it will be possible over the course of time to persuade the hon member for caerphilly and hi party that the measure in the bill are in the national interest and that they will make for a system of govern and relate between westminster and the european ion in which the british people have great confidence. final, i do not believe that the new clause will provide the additional safeguard during european ion negotiations that a numb of my hon friend suggest it would. what will strengthen the position of unite kingdom minister in negotiations i the knowledge around the t among minister from every other member state that if any treaty change i to be agree and ratify, it will have to enjoy the approval not on of the british govern of the day, but of the british people, express themselves through a referendum a provide for in the bill. i do not think that new clause 11 add to the safeguard that we have provide. while respect the integrity of the position of my hon friend the member for wellingborough, i would ask him not to press hi new clause to a division.",0,0.249,0.63,1

i am light to see that the justice department i now do this again - it would have known that all sort of other factor, include technology, technological develop and, of course, demographic factor, play a part in the crime trend. this i an omnibus bill. a such, it i a random cross - section of measure that have been thrown together for no great reason than the fact that they happen to be hang around at the bus stop at the time when the bill was go past. there are some pleasant - look passenger dotted around the bus, but the overall impression i, i fear, taint by the leer ogre pick it tee on the front seat on the top deck - namely the government proposal for the dna database. although a comb ha been rake through this beast tangle since the white paper, the effect i scarce please. it i the dominance of those proposal that will determine the fate of the bill, at least a far a liberal democrat member are concern. if the govern do not accept dramatic amendment in committee, we will be entitle to draw the conclusion that they are mere cock a snook at the european court of human right judgment in the s and marper case. that would be entire unacceptable, and we would not on oppose the bill on third read, but would do our utmost to beach it like a whale during wash - up. i have spoken before about the ministerial tendency to overdose on legislate laxative. this i the 69th home affair bill since 1997 and the 60th criminal justice bill. the govern are the proud father and mother of more than 3,600 new criminal offences. even those in favour of law, a i am, recognise that it i possible to have too much of a good the. this legislate diarrhoea i, frank, a conspiracy between minister who want to leave their footprint in the legislate sand and civil servant who recognise that the fast track to mote i to spend time with minister cuss their pet legislate proposal. even for this govern, this bill break new ground. it amend the police and crime act 2009, which receive royal assent just 13 day before the current bill was announce. the home office bill team have real outdone themselves on this occasion, and i think we can be sure that there i at least one part of the public sector where there can be no doubt about productivity performance, even if there remain some doubt - if i read what i happen across the house - about the quality of the duct. i am glad that the hon lady ha point that out; there certain seem to be more commotion in the box than i usual the case. before move on to the dna proposal, let me deal with some of the less controversial passenger on this particular bus. we welcome a reduction in police re tape, but in reduce the length and numb of form that the police are require to complete, we must ensure that we also monitor fair deal. stop and search of all kinds, but particular those carry out under terrorism legislate, proportionate affect ethnic minority. since 1997 - 98, black people have been almost eight time more likely to be stopped and asian people twice a likely to be stopped a white people. i accept that the require in primary legislate to cord the person ethnicity i a welcome move, but this must be kept under constant manage view. stop and search must be seen to be proportional to the threat if the police are to retain the confidence of minority community, which i so crucial in term of gather intelligence and ensure that witness come forward to secure conviction. the bill fail, however, to consider the problem of stop and search under section 44 and 45 of the terrorism act 2000, whereby they can be undertaken without the need for any suspicion at all. just last week, the govern again found themselves on the wrong side of a european court of human right rule on this very legislate. there have long been concerns about the mass overuse of section 44 power, particular by the metropolitan police. on 0.6 p cent. of people stopped under these power in the second quarter of 2008 went on to be arrest, and the government own terrorism advise, lord carlile, point out last year that search were bee carry out to provide "" racial balance "". yet in this bill the govern have made no move to tight up on their use. i hope that in committee minister will t amendment that address the issue that the european court of human right ha raise about section 44 and 45, and will ensure that these stop - and - search power are use in a proportionate manner by more tight draw the condition in which they can be deployed. apart from anything else, i agree that this i a sensible use of police time. in order to see that, we need on look at the success rate and the potential for alienate minority community, who we need to have on board if we are to tackle terrorism. this power need to be visit, a the echr ha made very clear. part 5 of the bill introduce measure to tackle domestic violence further, and to protect the victim of it in the immediate aftermath of a suspect offence. we welcome these so - call "" go "" order a a useful way to give victim of domestic violence the time and safety to make decisions about their future. however, it i imperative that these order are couple with support and counselling for victim, and temporary house for the perpetrator, a i the case in the other country upon whose vision they appear to be modelled. the hon gentleman ha considerable professional experience of the law, and he make a very good point, which i take serious. he i certain right to raise this issue given how many offences have been introduce since 1997 - and, indeed, some even before then - that it was perfect possible to prosecute under exist legislate. i am happy to look at this in committee if what the hon gentleman i suggest i indeed the case, although i am absolute convince that we need to do more to tackle domestic violence. i suspect that we will achieve a lot in that regard by persuade more police force to adopt the b practice of some, which i to go ahead with prosecute even when the victim i willing to g evidence, such a by use circumstantial or medical evidence about what ha happen. that appear to be an effect way of tackle domestic violence. however, have been out with my local police force and seen case of domestic violence, i real do think we need to deal with this a forceful a we possibly can. part 6 concerns gang junction for under - 18s. we are less happy about this area of the bill, since it appear to be another case of legislate on the hoof. these clause amend the recent police and crime act 2009, and they are baffle since the minister told the joint committee on human right in march last year that the govern had no intention of cover children and young people explicit. my party ha long argue that antisocial behaviour order, or asbos, should be a last sort. if overuse - there are parallel here with the so - call "" gangbos "" - they become effective and cost and potential criminalise a generate of young people. these gang junction seem to me to repeat many of the same mistake. they again blur the line between criminal and civil law. they criminalise young people without any thought a to how or why they find themselves caught up in the dark world of gang - relate violence, and they simply mimic many power that are already on the statute book. furthermore, they g the court power to impose draconian order on young people who breach these junction. a liberty ha so apt put it, we are, in essence, talk about "" a mixture of control order and asbos "". it i stagger that the govern are intent on expand these type of order for children, and we shall certain seek to amend these vision in committee. part 7 make the issue of a parent order mandatory upon the breach by a child of an asbo. parent order, in themselves, are often beneficial, but we are concern that these vision may result in such order bee use a a last sort, at the point when a child ha already been criminalised by breach a credit and overuse asbo; ideal, parent order should be use well ahead in this process. these measure do nothing to address the root cause of antisocial behaviour before they get out of hand. we need to catch children ear, create scheme that divert them away from crime and antisocial behaviour, and get them to take responsibility for their action when they stray, particular through restorative justice scheme and neighbourhood justice panel. on part 8, we thorough like the license regime for wheel - clamp business operate on private land. i see no justify for yet another license regime, so let u instead opt for a simple scottish - style solute and declare such clamp illegal entire, a it i tantamount to extortion. we should not be attempt to clean up this industry act by provide a license regime. final, i turn to part 2 to 4, which concern the dna database. to say that the government proposal are a appoint i an understatement - they are a scandal. they have round fail to address any of the concerns outline in the european court of human right rule in the case of s and marper about the "" blanket and indiscriminate nature "" of the database. the uk ha the large dna database in the world; it i far large than it american counterpart, despite the population of the unite state bee so much bigger. our database contain cord from more than 5.5 million people, almost 1 million of whom are innocent - they have no cord on the police national computer - and almost one in two of all black men are on the database. this i little more than a random accretion of file from anybody who happen to run to the police. we have heard in great tail, particular from the chair of the select committee on home affair, how difficult it can be, pend on where one live in the country, to get one tail move from this database, even when one want to do so. a i briefly mention, in december 2008 the echr rule that the retention of the dna sample of two men who had not been convict of any crime - s and marper - was illegal and violate their right to a private life. the court rule that "" the retention in question constitute a proportionate interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life and could not be regard a necessary in a democratic society "". it rule that this was not necessary in a democratic society i a stagger criticism - it said that the uk govern have collect the most personal information from innocent people in a database that i not fit for a democratic society. yet, rather than be humble or chasten by that, the govern are present proposal that fly in the face of the rule. it seem that they would rather continue their dangerous obsession with create mass and illegal database of any information they can get their hand on than accept that they were wrong and that they have gone beyond the law. the effective of the dna database for innocent a a tool for fight crime i itself high question. figure have shown that despite the huge crease in the numb of file on the database from 2.1 million in 2002 to 5.6 million at the last count, the numb of detect crime for which a dna match was avail - we are not even talk about it bee crucial to the conviction - ha fall from 21,098 to 17,614 last year. that doe not surprise me because, a i said, the database i random. it include 1 million innocent and exclude more than 2 million people who were convict before the database began. one sensible aspect of these proposal i to collect the dna of such convict. we will support that. there seem to be an absolute clear basis for ensure that that goes ahead. the hon lady i absolute right. that i a crucial principle. minister surreptitious begin to talk not about how a previous arrest i a good indicator of some future conviction, but about how a previous arrest i a good indicator of another future arrest. just because somebody i arrest twice, that doe not make them any more guilty than they were when they were arrest the first time, which was follow by no successful prosecute. i fear that minister are bee naive in their approach. the issue of principle i exact a the hon lady say. i know that the hon gentleman i a member of the special constabulary, and that he will therefore have had a certain amount of legal train, and he i aware that there i a difference between the standard of proof in a civil case and that in a criminal case. the standard of proof in a criminal case i that somebody ha to be convict beyond reason doubt. a a former journalist, i know that the standard of proof in a civil case, when it come to libel, i on the balance of probability. i salute the campaign that the daily mail ha run on this issue, but i mere point out to the hon gentleman that it i slight more difficult to bring a successful prosecute on a criminal basis than it i to fend oneself in the libel court. let me turn to the dna database. the evidence provide by the govern to support the retention of the dna of all innocent people for six year i a shamble. the so - call evidence in the consultation paper was base on an extreme small sample of search carry out by the jill dando institute of crime science, which it own director late note was incomplete and base on data to which the institute was not given direct access. the director state that it "" was probably a mistake with hindsight, we should have just said 'you might a well just stick your finger in the air and think of a number' "". further criticism came from professor sheila bird, a vice - president of the royal statistical society, who said that the consultation "" use of statistical science doe not enhance public trust "" and that "" mislead statistical argument in public consultation should be regard a a statistical felony "" - the statistical equivalent of "" lye to the house "". all the home office ha done i halve the period pose in the consultation document, a if splitting the difference were a substitute for evidence. the home secretary said today at the patch box that there was tremendous important evidence that would support hi evidence and that, a we speak, it i in the process of bee pee - view. i have new for him - there i a difference between something appear in a learn journal once it ha been pee - view and something that i go through the process of pee view. if search i go through the process of pee view, it ha not yet been accept for publication in a learn journal. that process can involve a substantial amount of revision on the part of the author. if, aft getting it finger burn in the case of the consultation paper and the jill dando institute, the home office ha not learn not to present to the house a load of half - baked evidence, it damn well ought to have done so. the home secretary ought to know that he should come here with evidence that i controvertible and base on search that i publish in a learn journal, not something that he hope will support hi point of view at some time in the future. our preferred alternate i a strict split between innocence and guilt. if a person i found guilty of a crime, their dna i retain on the database. if they are not convict of a crime, their dna i move from the database at the end of the investigate. it i a simple a that. the principle of bee innocent until prov guilty i the cornerstone of our criminal justice system. i have seen nothing in any of the so - call evidence provide by the govern today to convince me that we should abandon that principle now. to conclude, the adequate dna proposal loom so large over the entire bill that although there are posit element elsewhere, it i well overdue for the govern to take serious their obligate toward the european convention on human right not just in this matte, but in the matte of section 44 and 45 of the terrorism act. they should start with the bill. the dna proposal fail to respect the right to private life. they sacrifice the presumption of innocence over guilt on the basis of a cook consultation. they are an affront to british tradition of hard - won liberty and justice. i am sad to say that for that reason, despite some of the posit vision in the bill, we will not support it this even. rose - i am sure that, when we have had a chance to look at those measure, they are likely to command a great deal of support from all part of the house, but i urge the right hon gentleman - particular because the measure are likely to get so much support - not to try to use the issue a a camouflage for much more controversial proposal on the dna database. i assure him that, if the govern accept in committee our amendment on the dna database or, indeed, the expect conservative amendment, the bill i likely to go through with the measure that he care so much about. sure the right hon gentleman recognises that the extraordinary spate of new offences i simply unnecessary. i have correspond with the justice secretary on this matte, in which i gave him clear example of offences that it was already perfect possible to prosecute. the most ridiculous one i the new offence, which was create in 1997, of create a nuclear explosion. what i wrong with murder and criminal damage? it seem to me that either would be quite likely to cover the base. not very successful. the right hon gentleman ha a lot of experience in this area, but there are real problem with the case that he i try to make in regard to size p se. the biggest police force in the country certain ha a lot of problem that other police force - even those in other urban area - do not have. it also ha some pretty poor performance indicator, compare with other police force. so bigger doe mean more beautiful. rose -",0,-0.035,-0.023,-0.979

we all know that party get to trouble however they try to raise fund, so i this not the wrong direction to go in? i am grateful for the opportunity to tribute to this important discussion. the entire issue of fix - term parliament, sad, i in dang of becoming yet another political football to be kick around the house, a member seek to manufacture objection to form, and to posture and grandstand. i fear that the new clause and amendment for the most part would not add to the bill in any meaningful way. the issue i real very simple. i believe that the bill will strengthen the power of the house over a key constitutional issue and diminish the prime minister power. before come to the tail of the new clause and amendment, let u member exact what this historic bill i about. previous, the prime minister had the power to ask for an ear dissolute of parliament at any time. historical, that extraordinary degree of power ha been use solely to the political advantage of the party in power. i am grateful to my hon friend for allude to an argument that i have heard time and again, when people suggest, "" if it isn't broke, don't fix it, "" but i shall come to the problem with the current situate in a moment. he also allude to the interesting idea that we have a democratic system that work, so we should not amend or tinker with it. i have heard opposite member support that idea before. i have heard it suggest that, somehow, the bill i democratic. with the great respect to my hon friend, i find that an extraordinary argument. that line of reason seem to suggest that the on truly democratic system i the one that ha evolve in this country - the one that we current use. such reason suggest that it i not possible to amend our system without somehow make it less democratic, even though it concentrate power in the prime minister hand. the bill will devolve the power to call a general election to the house, which i sure where it belong. if one were to follow that line of reason to it absurd conclusion, it would suggest that other western nation are somehow less democratic than our, simply because they have democratic system different from the one that we enjoy. in the unite state congressmen and women serve a two - year fix term. the president serve a four - year fix term. senator serve six - year fix term. clear, that doe not make the unite state less democratic than we are simply because it system i different from our. in france member of the national assembly are elect for f - year term - the period that the bill commend. the president i also elect for a f - year term. the senate i select for a six - year term. i am grateful to the hon gentleman for correct me. that was not my understand, but i will bow to hi superior knowledge. the french model ha an interesting lesson to teach u about leave the power to solve parliament with the execute, a oppose to the system that we are now consider. the president of france ha the power to force dissolute ear, but that i not suppose to be the norm; it i suppose to be use on in an emergency. it ha been use on twice in an emergency, in 1962 and 1968, but it ha been use three time for political advantage - in 1981, 1988 and 1997 - thus clear demonstrate that if we leave such a power in the hand of the execute, it will inevitably be use for party political advantage. i am grateful for my hon friend's typical pithy and interesting contribute. the point ha been made by hon member on both side of the house, and while my hon friend i technical correct, i find it hard to imagine that a govern who wish to call an ear general election for their own political advantage would engineer a vote of no confidence that they would then lose on the floor of the house, because that would be a disastrous start to a general election campaign. i will have to agree to agree with hon member about this, but i do not think that a govern go to a general election would want to see headline on the front page of the sun and other tabloid scream, "" govern fall aft lose confidence vote in the house "". my hon friend make a truly innovate suggestion. i shall be light to find out whether the hon gentleman can answer the point raise by my hon friend the member for broxbourne. i am grateful to the hon gentleman for hi clever and well - reason argument. i am light that the hon gentleman raise that question, because i would like to address that issue, which i one of the "" straw man "" argument that opponent of the bill regular cite. some who oppose the bill argue against the whole principle of fix - term parliament, while other claim to support that principle, but tackle the issue of whether the term should be f year or four. what should we make of the term set out in the bill? i think that i am safe in say that the term length i a key stick point for labour member who accept the principle of fix - term parliament yet still cannot bring themselves to support the bill. many of them hang their hat on the fact that f - year, rather than four - year, term are pose. if we are to consider that point in tail, it i important that we understand where we are and how we came to be here. at present the maximum length of a parliament i f year - let u make no bone about that - and i do not call any recent cry of anguish from labour member that the historical f - year parliament i wrong. indeed, that maximum limit was establish under the parliament act 1911, so labour member have had a long time to express their opposite to f - year parliament. the 1911 act reduce the maximum length of a parliament to f year from seven year by amend the septennial act 1715. a ever, i am extreme grateful to my hon friend for hi point. he and i believe that the wisdom of our forefather should not be lightly miss. i do not understand my hon friend's point at all. our forefather decide that f year was a reason maximum length for a parliament. the hon gentleman ha advance that argument before, but i am aware that another interpretation i that if a parliament last f year, on about four years' work get done in practice, because government find it hard to get their busy through in the final year a people are look ahead to the next general election: in effect, the election campaign start. my hon friend make a valid point. the hon member for rhondda like to cite a figure of 3.7 year a the average length of a parliament since 1945 - he doe not need to jump up and do so again now - but we need to tackle that statistic head on, because it i quite ingenuous. the statistic include the three occasion on which a parliament last for less than two year. no one would suggest that parliament of less than two year should be the norm - they occur in usual circumstance - so it i mislead to include them in statistic to show the average length of a parliament since 1945. the hon gentleman make an interesting argument, because he seem to suggest that any govern of the day should have such a strong majority that they can bash their legislate through. i believe that labour member referred to that arrange a an elect dictatorship when they were on the wrong side of such figure in the 1980s. in this day and age, if a govern need to be a bit more consensual and clever about getting their busy through the house, it i consider to be a good the. do we real want to say that whenever a govern do not have a huge thump majority we should have another election? i genuine do not believe that that i the reason. my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe point out that three of the last f parliament last f year, and i was develop a point about the average length of post - 1945 parliament. if the three fail parliament last less than two year are stripped out, the average length of a parliament since 1945 ha been more than four year. since 1974 the lengths have been even great, so there i a clear trend that parliament are last longer. if the hon gentleman i argue that parliament that last for f year are more likely to end with the defeat of the govern, he should be wholehearted embrace the coalition plan to make this parliament last for f year. if there i something so constitutional or democratically wrong with f - year parliament, why on earth did we have to endure the previous govern from 2005 until 2010? if f - year parliament are wrong in principle, a several labour member seem to suggest, why did not the right hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath - i apologise if i have not pronounce the right hon gentleman constituency correct, but a i have heard him speak in the house so rare, i am not sure how to pronounce it - do the entire country a favour and call an election in 2009? we then could have start clear up the mess of the worst financial deficit that this country ha face since the second world war a year early. i entire agree with my hon friend's comment. one problem sometime cite in relate to a democratic system such a our i the tendency for government to take the short - term approach to fix problem. if f year became the norm, that would help to create slight more stable govern, because government could look to the longer term when consider some of the difficult decisions that they might have to make, and not always be worry that they were on a few year from a general election. it seem that f - year parliament are not a problem for labour member when it i their party that i cling to power in the dye day of a govern, a was the case in 2009 and 2010. true to form, their principle change the moment they found themselves in opposite. now, sad, they stand a obstacle to form. may i conclude the point about whether the term should be four year or f, and move on with my speech? i am grateful to my hon friend for hi intervention. i am extreme concern about that point, and very eager to get on to the part of my speech in which i shall address it. however, i want to conclude the point, which i was pull on to by intervention, about whether the term should be fix at four year or f. i turn again to the conclusion and commendation in the port on the bill produce by the political and constitutional form committee, which ha already been quote today by labour member. commendation 5 clear state: "" precedent give no clear answer a to whether parliament should last four year or f. "" in commendation 6 the port acknowledge the view express by some witness that four year might be better than f. nevertheless, the commendation clear state that that "" i an important point, but not one that we would wish to see obstruct the passage of the bill through the house. "" that i important, and i hope that labour member will take note of it. before move on to the subject of the amendment before the house, i would like briefly to - i am grateful to you, mr deputy speak. i have almost come to the end of my scene - sett mark and will get to considerably more tail on the amendment very short. before i do, i want to f to confidence vote and threshold, which have already been mention this afternoon, include by labour member. although we are move to a system of fix - term parliament, it would clear be usual and wrong to put in place a system that did not allow for ear election, in one of two scenario: if the confidence of the house could not be held by a party lead, or if there were an emergency of some sort, or another exceptional circumstance that require an ear election in the national interest. i believe that the bill a it stand, unamended - i am grateful to you, mr deputy speak, and i apologise. thank you very much, mr deputy speak. i shall move on to new clause 4, which set out new rule for the prorogation - i have a much trouble a the hon member for rhondda with that word - of parliament and would peal the prorogation act 1867, which provide the power for h majesty to issue a proclamation for the prorogation of parliament. i think i got that right. a the house i aware, prorogation mark the end of a parliamentary session and i the formal name given to the period between the end of one session of parliament and the state open of parliament, which begin the next session. the parliamentary session may also be prorogue before parliament i dissolve and a general election call. it i worth mind ourselves that the term "" prorogation "" i rive from the roman concept of prorogatio. in the constitute of ancient rome, prorogatio was the extension of a commander imperium beyond the one - year term of hi magistracy. prorogatio develop a a legal procedure in response to roman expansionism and militarisation. in the text of the westminster system, prorogation or dissolute of parliament on the final day of the session original, accord to the house of lord library, comprise four principal element. first, the speak made a speech main concern with the subsidy bill, which he had brought up from the commons. this was follow by a speech from the lord chancellor or lord keep ply to the point made by the speak and express thank for the subsidy bill. royal assent was then given to the bill passe by both house. final, the lord chancellor, in obedience to the sovereign instruction, either prorogue or dissolve parliament. the sovereign was customarily present on those occasion, and from the 17th century onwards, usual made the speech before prorogation or dissolute. hon. member will, i am sure, be fascinate to learn from the library excellent note that "" in the ear nineteen century the prorogation was still accompany with considerable ceremony. thus in 1815 the prince gent rode in the state coach with a cavalry escort through st james's park to the palace of westminster, and on hi arrival was announce with a salute of cannon. "" i am extreme grateful to my hon friend for hi intervention. that i exact the point that i would have made. the bill i truly historic. that fact ha been mention by numerous member on both side of the house, and to consider it in isolation - what it mean to u now, rather than it place within the sweep of the history of our nation - would be wrong. i am grateful to the hon gentleman for hi intervention. i am extreme grateful to my hon friend for hi intervention. again he demonstrate why it i so important to maintain a thorough understand of history if we are to understand exact what our position in this place i in the text - it pain me wholehearted to agree with my hon friend that that i absolute the case. i am extreme grateful to the hon gentleman for join our discussion of the history pertain to prorogation. i am glad that he ha recognised that understand the history of how we have got to where we are today i relevant to the discussion at hand. however, a the house i clear not in the mood to cuss history today, and a i am aware that time i press, i want to move on and make a final point about amend 9 before bring my mark to a conclusion. clause 3 state: "" once parliament dissolve, h majesty may issue the proclamation summon the new parliament which may... appoint the day for the first meet of the new parliament "". amend 9 would add: "" within 15 work day of the poll day "". the issue ha already been cuss, but i am concern that the amend remain a little woolly. i question it purpose. what doe a work day mean? doe that take to account religious holiday? there ha already been a discussion about whether "" work day "" or "" day "" should be use. if that i an issue that the opposite are concern about, the term "" work day "" remain vague. are bank holiday in other part of the unite kingdom to be taken to account? i it not difficult to add "" within 15 work day "" in such specific term, when "" work day "" could mean something entire different in another part of the unite kingdom? in particular, why i labour adamant about 15 work day? i there any rationale or logic behind this numb? why not 14 day or 16 day? if we believe in evidence - base policy make in this place - i detect some chuckle. perhaps that i a dangerous thought. evidence i not always welcome in this place. i have discover that in previous bate. perhaps when he sum up, the hon member for rhondda will explain to u why 15 day i the magic numb, not 14 or 16. the house ha indulge me enough. time i press and there may be other who wish to speak. i thank the house for it attention.",0,0.153,0.278,1

"" that i what will happen. people on house benefit and lha will be price out of some of their local community because the first port of call for the private landlord i those people who have a secure come - people who are actual in work. a the federate ha said, f to 10 people in work are chase every let, compare with two or three people on house benefit. that i one of the main reason why rent will not automatically come down. a major survey by the cambridge centre for house and planning search ha found: "" a majority of 500 landlord survey for the study believe the change will crease arrears, and a large portion of those who current let to lha claimant tend to reduce the numb of such tenancy they off. "" those are some of the issue that we need to address. we should not focus on house benefit and tenant and think that these people are just sitting watch the televise all day long. perhaps some of them are, but a lot of them are not. some are pension, some are out of work because they have been force out of work, and some are among the f people chase every job vacancy. the govern must front these issue. it i about not just sort out the tenant, but sort out the re of the market, too. let me end on one point. i have with me a copy of a written answer from the treasury. at the moment, about 100,000 tenant in the private sector are pay rent to private landlord - about 44,000 of them - who have not paid tax on that rental come. more than 50 % of those landlord are receive come from house benefit claimant. the govern need to look to that. it i a case not just of tenant claim benefit, but of many people in the private sector who rent out property who are not play the game. we need to look at both side, not just one. those affect by the cut will find it increasing difficult to find a place to live. i quote most of the paragraph. in the private sector there are good landlord and bad landlord. the problem i that many of them are amateur landlord who have one or two property. that sector need to be regulate, and a national register would be extreme helpful. how can the hon gentleman expect private landlord to reduce their rent when for every one person on lha want a property, f to 10 people in work are look for the same property? who are private landlord go to go for? they are go to go for the person in work.",1,0.08,0.08,0.976

236,"i this possibly the first time on the cord that a liberal democrat ha blame the european ion for anything? we are full up. i rise to speak a the chair of the scottish affair committee, rather than a a constituency member. i will therefore not explain why the construction of two aircraft carry i absolute vital to the maintenance of royal mail and the postal service. we decide a a select committee that it was not appropriate for u to consider ownership or pension issue, because they were not main scottish issue, but we want to consider particular the future of the universal service obligate and the future of post office, a they are of great importance to rural and deprive area in scotland than perhaps they are to many other area of the country. we took a a given the importance of the role that post office and royal mail play in the community. a numb of other member have already referred to that. normal procedure doe not necessarily mean that we cannot repeat exact what other member have said, but i will not do so in these circumstance. i want to move on to our commendation on these issue. we met the minister and had a hear with him, and it was general our view that he was not near a bad a people l u to believe. he was sincere in hi view. we all thought that he want to support the maintenance of the post office network and the universal service obligate. there was no doubt in our view that hi heart in all this was in the right place. fortunate, we did, however, think that hi head was a bit muddle. the minister and ourselves had identify the fact that the inter - busy agree was absolute essential for the future of post office, but we were not convince that he appreciate the necessity to make it a firm a possible. we took the view that hi good intention, which we accept, were not sufficient, because event might occur that submerge a host of good intention. we have already seen the govern use the economic crisis a an excuse to ditch all sort of commitment that both coalition party made before the election. we therefore took the view, a ronald reagan did with the russians on missile, "" trust, but verify. "" we accept hi good intention, but we want to ensure that the were pinned down a firm a possible. we welcome the minister state that he did not tend to put anything in the way of such an agree. we took the view that there was a hierarchy of way in which it could be approach. undertake to move obstacle - well, not object to do so in the first place - we took a a given. he indicate that he was keen to see obstacle move. one of our commendation i that the minister take posit step to facilitate a long and robust iba and to move any obstacle, whether practical, legal or otherwise, that may exist. clarify whether there are obstacle to a 10 - year iba bee sign now would move a lot of the anxiety about whether the european ion i block this or any other agree. a the second line of pursuit, we want a voluntarily enter - to 10 - year iba agree before any such sale. there seem no reason from what we heard from the minister, given that he was willing to overcome any obstacle, why a voluntarily enter - to iba could not be sign before sale took place. we said: "" we understand that this may affect the marketability of royal mail, but it i essential to the sustainability of postal service in scotland. "" we appreciate that royal mail sign an iba might affect the price that it achieve, because it might be seen a a less attract commercial operate than would otherwise be the case. we none the less agree that we want to include that because the preservation of post office through the construction of an iba and it implementation before privatisation or a change of ownership was absolute vital. no, we took exact the opposite view. we accept that royal mail would probably want to have the post office network. that network i important to royal mail, but it i not utter and absolute essential, whereas the verse i not the case. it i a question of ham and egg. the pig make a much great commitment than the h, so we took the view that, if there were a privatised royal mail or a change of ownership, which i free to negotiate with post office, it would be likely to drive a much, much hard bargain. it would seek, for entire understand commercial reason, to drive the post office network to the ground a much a possible, to extract the maximum possible advantage from those negotiations, because it would not be directly responsible for the future of the post office network. that i why we took the view that the post office position was likely to be strong before any change of ownership, so it was b agree now, rather than late. no, i do not agree with that at all, because i do not believe that a structure will be establish for royal mail that necessarily allow all shareholder to come round and cast a collect vote on whether they want to maintain a collect post office network. it will be in the management interest to maximise the turn for the shareholder, so screw the post office to the ground will probably be in their interest. i am sorry if my comparison about ham and egg, and chick and bacon was not understood. the concept i that the pig provide the bacon, and the chick provide the egg. the chick can carry on afterward, but it i not quite a easy for the pig. i am sorry if that i beyond senior member of the conservative party, but we are prepare to explain these the to them late. turn to the question of how we can secure the strong possible commitment to the iba, a pose in the new clause, which the committee had not seen when it prepare it port, we thought that have that in legislate would be an extreme strong protection. if the minister can g u an assurance that legislate i not necessary because the same the will be achieve without legislate before there i any question of a sale, then, because we are reason, we would be satisfy. however, the house will understand our anxiety, because aft the by - election on thursday, the minister might not be here any longer. we want to make sure, while he i in a position of authority, that he allow hi heart to rule and produce measure that we find accept. i should like to touch on one or two other worry issue relate to the post office. on the size of the network in scotland, we accept that the government access criteria are helpful in sett out the structure of the network that they want. we welcome, too, the fact that they tend to keep 11,500 post office. however, it i not the case that the access criteria necessarily mean that the 11,500 will remain, because our understand i that the access criteria could be met with 7,500 post office. a commitment to 11,500 i not necessarily a commitment to the 11,500 that are there at the moment. it would be possible in those circumstance for a substantial denude of the post office service to take place in the highland, the island, the border or argyll. rural area could maintain the present access criteria, and the 11,500 criterion could be met because other post office might set up elsewhere in urban area, but the service would undoubted be worse than it was before. the minister shake hi head. i would welcome a commitment from him that the intention i to maintain the network pretty much a it i. i genuine understand hi difficulty. individual post office are controlled by individual private tractor. we cannot legislate to fuse somebody permission to leave. there will always be some degree of come and go. if it were one in, one out in a particular area, we would not object to that, but there could quite easily be a couple of hundred post office go out of the rural area or the poor area, and a couple of hundred start up in the rich area where need i perhaps less. the minister criterion would still be met, but the social objective that we are pursue would be lost. the committee unanimous welcome the point that the minister was make about the access criteria and the fact that he was guaranteeing, a i understood it, 11,500 post office, but sure he will accept that hi guarantee doe not guarantee the same 11,500. it doe not guarantee them in the same location. in some area, particular rural area, where there are small post office, the access criteria are, thankful, better met. one of those could easily close, one could open somewhere else, such a london, and both set of criteria would still be met. if the minister cannot g u a commitment today, perhaps he will take that away and consider whether something could be done at a late stage in the passage of the bill. i think that he accept that this i a genuine anxiety and that we are here to help him. we are identify gap in vision and try to strengthen the bill. the hon gentleman serve with me on the scottish affair committee. a he will member, we were not commend that there should be a change to the legislate on this point. unanimous we agree that putt it in legislate would be too difficult, and we understood the minister difficulty in identify a policy that would encompass these point. but we want to raise the matte again because it was raise with u on a numb of occasion by people who could see how the government commitment could, in effect, continue to be met while there was none the less a deteriorate in service. the minister ha made the point that the tractor are dependent. if somebody leave a post office, somebody else will have to decide whether they want to take that on. aft the next election, there may well be a numb of liberal democrat look for new job, and they may consider whether to become sub - postmaster. so, i am actual think of the minister a much a anything else. he might wish to become a sub - postmaster in those circumstance, and, to turn to a previous point, i am sure that he would much prefer a 10 - year, or what might then be a f - year, guarantee with royal mail to one of on a few week. again, it would be for hi own good. that seem like a very construct way of look at the issue. i am not sure about the practicality, and nobody else raise the matte with u during our discussion, so we have not introduce it a a commendation. we were interest in the outcome, however, and we had sufficient faith in the minister and hi support staff to identify way in which it could be achieve. that bring me to the other point about which we had anxiety. it relate to the point about the numb of outlet, and it i the issue of wander van. the govern have committed to a certain numb of outlet, and the minister ha indicate that he want to have 11,500, but an outlet can be a van that stop for a certain period at a locate and then move on; it doe not necessarily have to be a post office. we have already heard how some sub - post office and outreach facility were not consider adequate, and the hon member for banff and buchan describe how people had to queue outside some of them in the rain and snow. the facility were not always satisfactory, and we worry that the govern will be able to meet their target of 11,500 by introduce a numb of wander van that go to f place a day, f day a week, mean that 25 outlet are cover. so, 100 peripatetic van - to use their sunday name - would cover a substantial numb of the 11,500 outlet that the minister identify, and that i clear not what we tend. it would therefore be helpful if he indicate the criteria that will apply when decide to introduce a wander van. i he willing to state that there will be a maximum numb? we do not want the commitment to 11,500 outlet undermine and value by there bee not even full - time van, but part - time van that appear for on a limit numb of hour p week. that i the final area of the pose change on which we want the minister clarify. again, if he doe not feel able to provide it today, i hope that he will find it possible to produce appropriate statement before the legislate i finalised. perhaps it would be helpful if we clarify whether it would be possible, without an iba, for royal mail to do a deal with tesco, other supermarket and a numb of bank, and to fill in the miss part of the jigsaw with post office. sure that i the alternate that we ought to be worry about. that i the dang of go down the road indicate by the hon member for folkestone and hythe. he seem to think that the option i between the post office in it entirety and tesco in it entirety. a predatory royal mail could easily decide to pick and mix. the dang i that we would be left with a small numb of post office, with the re place willy - nilly by tesco and the like. could we possibly agree, first, that the eu i a bad the? second, i the minister tell u that he doe not wish to have the new clause in the bill in case the eu step in, while also promise u that he i go to do all this anyway?",1,0.123,0.345,1
237,"i associate myself with the tone of the contribute made by the home secretary and the hon member for sou - east cambridgeshire. we are all charge with find a way to reduce antisocial behaviour and to create a society in which great respect i shown by one person for another. we may have differences about how we achieve that, but that i certain a common object. i express share the home secretary view about the event in wrexham over the past couple of day, and i wish to associate myself with hi comment on that subject. i commend the work of the police, who were front with an unacceptable series of event. i also commend the local elect representative. i heard the mayor speak this morn, and he was clear that there was no justify for such lawless, unacceptable tolerance, especial a it was found on a specious premise. that community ha traditional been happy, prosperous and settle. if it cannot, with understand and compassion, accommodate a few people who have been accept to the community, there i something severe wrong with the perpetrator of those crime. the home secretary and hi colleague will know that my hon friend and i agree with some part of the bill, such a part 1 deal with crack house. clear, we all sign up to those proposal, and we need to get them right. we also welcome the proposal on firearm. it i important that we get a grip of the antisocial use of firearm in both urban and rural area. minister will also appreciate that we have differences of principle. my hon friend the member for mid - dorset and north poole, support by my hon friend the member for ludlow, sought in committee to put our amendment. they did not prevail, so we must ask ourselves whether, if we were in govern, we would want the bill on the statute book, and the answer i no, a there i still a lot to do to it. we will divide the house on third read to register that view. we are concern about the process that take people too quick from demote tenancy to lose their house. we also think that it i entire inappropriate for teach or school staff to serve fix penalty notice under part 3. the argument may be made for the director of educate or the senior educate welfare office to do that, but it i not a job that should be given to teach or to the people responsible for the welfare and support of children. i assure the right hon gentleman that my colleague and i have been clear that antisocial behaviour, proper define, i entire unacceptable. however, we believe that the b method to deal with that i not crease, discriminatory, authoritarian power, but a active, support approach. there should be alternate activities for young people, and more source, more police, more community support office and the re. we have been clear that we support some measure but not other. we made clear our opposite to the power to disperse group, which we believe are unnecessary. there are many power on the statute book that can be use. many people outside the house share our view that these power go far too far. the objection to the fix penalty notice in part 5 i that the pilot ha not yet finish and we have not seen the evidence. there i no case yet for extend that measure, let alone extend it to teenage and to children age 10 upward. it i unacceptable that those who are least likely to pay or to be able to afford to pay, and against whom the measure i least likely to be enforce, should be subject to a new fine collect system that ha not been try and test. we accept some part of the bill, but it i entire unacceptable that people of 16 or 17, who are adult, can go to work, pay tax and serve their country, are not allow to buy can of spray paint that they can use legitimate. we have made our position clear. we will work with the govern, despite our differences in this place. we hope that the indicate from the home secretary, from minister and from conservative front - bench member will be that further work will be done on the bill in the house of lord. we hope that, by the time that it end it passage in the house of lord, it will be a much better bill. we will work to win by argument what we have not won today by vote. we hope that the govern realise that it i the posit, active alternative that reduce crime and deal with the cause of crime. that was our view at the beginning; that remain our view now. we will continue to argue that view both today and during the remain stage of the bill.",0,0.114,0.154,0.997

i just feel in my gut that it i the right length of time for a govern. a four - year term i better because it would fit with local govern election and devolve assemblies. the canadian govern change from f to four year a couple of year ago, and we have heard about the three - year term that exist in australia and new zealand. for me, four year would be a more appropriate term for u to be in office. there i an acceptance that aft bee in power for f year, we tend to be a little too detach from the electorate, and consequent end up make bad decisions. however, i cannot support the three - year term pose by my near neighbour, next door but one, in great grimsby. that would throw u to a perpetual state of election. it i often said about u congressional election that american congressmen are in a perpetual state of election, which i why they have so many earmark and pork barrelling; they have no soon got themselves to washington dc than they have to run back to their electorate to try to gain election. the problem with the american senator term i that a third of the senate i elect every two year, which mean that they, too, are in a perpetual state of election, so that idea doe not carry over complete. the other experience of more regular election i that there tend to be a great propensity on the part of the electorate to re - elect their incumbent. a i am now an incumbent, that i not necessarily something that i would take issue with. i suspect that all hon member would be happy to see incumbent re - elect - well, ye, perhaps their own incumbency re - elect. i was particular intrigue by the comment of the hon member for great grimsby that election off the opportunity for politician to charge their battery. that i certain not an experience i have ever had in an election campaign. i was involve in that in new jersey in 2000. such matte were determine on a state - by - state basis and pend very much on who was in control in that state. it i not quite the case that congressmen themselves are busy divide up their own seat, but there are example where that happen. i conclude where i start. for me, a four - year term feel more natural. a i said, i have no academic support for this argument. to go to the electorate every four year, which fit in proper with the election in scotland and wale, feel the right the to do. i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment and i look forward to the comment of opposite member who, have enjoy a f - year term, now seek to criticise the govern for seek to continue them. a interesting a the example from europe are, doe the hon gentleman not agree that the country that share our monarch and have exact the same problem with prerogative power and so on provide a better example of where we should be head?",1,0.131,0.108,0

"" - where i the relative dependent body in these proposal? rose - graceful. that give the lie to it. rose - the secretary of state cannot have it both way. he cannot, on the one hand, right highlight the fact that the pain of the change would be share equal across both side of the house and then, on the other hand, say that it ha been put forward for party political advantage. may i gently point out to him that the unite state ha gerrymander because the vote and the selection of the constituency and their size are determine by the legislature without intervention from any dependent boundary commission? a this decision will be in the hand of the boundary commissioner, i hope that the secretary of state will now withdraw that ludicrous allegation. i am truly sorry to see the secretary of state bee oblige to be associate with this guff. the b start point would be for the secretary of state to take a short absence from the chamber to look at the excellent blog site run by hi son, will straw, on which there ha been extensive poll in left - of - centre area of radicalism about these proposal. no more than 20 p cent., he ha conclude, support the alternate vote pose by the govern and 29 p cent. want no referendum at all. perhaps we should not be surprise to learn, particular from a left - of - centre blog, that the vast majority of the remainder want such disparate the that it i impossible to assess what they sire. i think that the secretary of state would have done rather well to have consider that blog first. the govern have table new clause 88 at this late stage of the proceed - indeed, at this late stage of the life of new labour - follow the prime minister belated verse to the cause of electoral form, which he ha so successful and personal obstruct for more than a decade. for the benefit of hon member on the bench to my left, i think that it i worth capping the history of new labour's verse to the cause of electoral form. in 1990, labour set up the plant commission, which commend something that was basically the alternate vote. what was the view of the prime minister? he said that it was "" defeatism "" and attack "" those who say labour cannot win and who seek refuge from labour's mission ahead a a crusade for change in the technicality of electoral manoeuvring and horse - trade "". how the mighty are fall. in 1997, the govern were elect on a clear manifesto promise of a referendum on electoral form. we all know that it was a vice - we know what happen when the prime minister promise a referendum. the govern got lord jenkins to vise an alternate vote system. let u member what lord jenkins thought of av, which the liberal democrat will support, i assume, if they cannot get their amend through. he said that it i "" even less proportional "" than the first - past - the - post system, "" disturbing predictable "", and "" unfair "" to the conservative party - not that that ha ever affect liberal democrat and labour think very much. he pose the proportional system, av - plus, which he thought fair. what happen to the promise of a referendum? at that point, the government commitment to it complete fad away. i am extreme certain what the justice secretary i go on about. my view, particular in light of hi mark about the state to which the house ha fall, i that the electorate want the opportunity to express their view, and that if they happen to have a very adverse view of a member of parliament, they will want that member to be move. the last the that they want i a situate in which the person against whom they have an adverse view come second, but then magical come first when the alternate vote are transferred. i agree entire with my right hon friend and i apologise if i did not do justice to the point that my hon friend the member for gainsborough made when i ply to hi intervention. i accept entire that the search that ha been carry out on this matte show clear, a i have illustrate in term of the electorate will, that the system skew the result of election in a way that i manifest unfair. i believe in the first - past - the - post system and that the secretary of state, in term of hi adherence to the alternate vote, doe too. that i what distinguish my party from the liberal democrat, who have been clamouring for proportional presentation for a long time because that i the on way in which they might wield any influence. rose - let me make some progress. i fully understand the hon gentleman point, but i believe that the first - past - the - post system deliver clear, clean result. that i why my party ha consistent adhere to that system, whether it ha been to the party advantage or disadavantage to do so. that i more than can be said for the govern, a i clear from the consistency in the way in which they are operate. my hon friend i quite right. the list system ha effective destroy european election for all practical purpose in the mind of the electorate, and i one of the great aster that we have visit upon the country. that i reflect in low turnout and the contempt that people feel about what i now a sort of buggins' turn system that i dictate by the political party. it seem to me that it i a legitimate system whatever the percentage, because the electorate are ask a perfect straightforward question - who do they wish to represent them? it give the majority view on a single person. i am sorry that the hon gentleman cannot see that. the system i straightforward, simple and quire people to make sensible choice about who i likely to be elect and who they might therefore wish to support. for those reason, i think that the system i extreme clear and command widespread support. in my constituency - i make this point also in the text of the liberal democrat - i get very few presentation about change the electoral system. i suspect that the same i true for many hon member. the more that people study proportional presentation system, include purist system such a that in israel, the more they must conclude that such system saddle country with impossible legislature, that no proper governance can be carry out under them and that they bring inertia. for those reason, pr doe not commend itself to me. in a moment. let me make a tiny bit more progress. i was just point out that when the first great form went to the sand, it was the lead of the liberal democrat who point out that it was the then chancellor, the current prime minister, who block it. the current home secretary ha said that labour "" lost the will to carry it through... when narrow party political advantage dominate our internal bate in the labour party. "" i fear that the justice secretary i move toward that position again, because the on conclusion that one can reach from the coherent proposal before u i that they are seen to have a narrow party political advantage for the govern. many govern back benchers, however, can see that the proposal are serious flaw. i agree that voter have a choice. frank, i am singular concern about the liberal democrats' preference or tendency, or about where they will go for a second vote. i am by no mean persuade that the hon member for battersea i right. the evidence from my constituency i that it i most improbable that liberal democrat voter would exercise a second preference vote in favour of a labour candidate, but the might be different in other place. in a moment. when the prime minister took office in 2007, he promise to publish a view. in 2005, labour announce that it was conduct a view, and in 2007 he said that he was go to publish it. this i a key issue because he did not make any attempt to hide the fact that the port had already been written. in fact, it was effective lock in the justice secretary bottom draw. there was a problem with the 2005 view because even though it term of reference were to look at the vote system that were use, someone, in conduct the view for the labour party, seem to have ask the team to look at the alternate vote a well. the conclusion that the view came to was that the av was cap of produce even more proportionate outcome national than the first - past - the - post system. i agree entire with my right hon friend. i was not go to quote churchill, but it seem to me that that i a problem that he correct identify in 1931 - the proportionate weight that the system would g to the view of those who are idiotic or ridiculous. in a moment. i thought that we had sort this out in intervention on the secretary of state. we are talk there about elect a single person to an office, not about elect a parliament. in any event, it i not an alternate vote system, a on two people go to the electorate. the electorate do not have a choice between more than two candidate in the first place. in a moment. i am sure that there i a sire to interrupt an account of what happen in 2007, because it highlight the full extent to which the govern cut the ground from under their own argument. in january 2008, the secretary of state publish hi view, from which the section on the alternate vote system had mysterious and convenient appear. however, anyone bother to read the tail would see that the view provide a snapshot of what would have happen at the 2005 general election, had it been run under a variety of vote system. helpful for the prime minister, on page 130 it also provide a useful ready reckoner. it consider in depth the d'hondt method, the least - squares proportionality system and arrow paradox, but what was plump for was the on system that would have given labour even more seat than first - past - the - post at the 2005 election. i might add that the same system was the on one that would have given the conservative party few seat than in 2005 - even though, in england, we gain a majority of the vote cast. from the many bate that we have had on scotland, the hon gentleman know that we are specter of the devolution settlement. i am happy to bate form of the first - past - the - post system there, and indeed the secretary of state ha try to bate that too, but our respect for devolution mean that, notwithstanding our support for form, we would not impose a new system. that i something that must be determine by the scottish govern and electorate. however, i do share the view of the hon member for central ayrshire in one respect. when i visit scotland, the people to whom i speak are not, on the whole, conservative party support. my experience i that there seem to be a great deal of satisfaction with the electoral system that ha been foist on the scottish electorate, who appear to be deep happy with it. for those reason, i believe that the scottish system i something that the house ought to heed, a it doe not off a good reason why we should go down the same road. ye, it i fair. i have no difficulty with the first - past - the - post system for westminster election, a i have made clear. the fact that my party in scotland ha very poor presentation in scotland i a challenge that we must do something about. if we cannot, we will continue to have very poor level of presentation - simple a that. no. i do not. i understood the secretary of state to say that he assume that people would vote different. that i another piling - on of assumption, and i do not think that this house should legislate on the basis of such assumption. all i can do i point out what the port say, include the fact that it make it clear that the alternate vote system would have deliver more seat than the first - past - the - post system for labour in 2005, even though it on gain 36 p cent. of the popular vote. that seem to me to be a very poor start - point for change in that direction. ye, i agree entire with my right hon friend. i presume that the minister of state was speak on behalf of the govern, so it i astonish that he should rise to hi feet and say - sudden and almost ex improviso - that the committee should not follow that series of assumption. we have to make a judgment, on the basis of what the evidence suggest. i have a soft spot for the secretary of state, and i have to tell my hon friend that i wonder whether he real ha change hi mind. the way that the new clause ha been introduce, the length of time that it took to germinate, the internal bate that clear took place at parliamentary labour party meet and the sound that one could hear come out of the room where they took place - all of that rather strong suggest that the secretary of state was fight a rearguard action against a prime minister who was both lose the plot and taking leave of hi political sense in a desperate bid to stay in office. my hon friend make a very good point. there i something somewhat unreal about this, and i shall turn in a moment to consider why the govern have act a they have. i agree entire with my right hon friend, but this i not the first time that we have had surreal proposal from labour member. i want to turn to what ha happen recent. last week, aft 13 year in power, on week away from a general election and with the secretary of state party behind in the poll, the prime minister decide that he i go to break yet another promise. whereas he previous said that he would put a commitment to a referendum on av to the people at a general election, and notwithstanding hi party internal bate, he i now go to introduce the system in this bill. it i very difficult to take serious a person who i dither around for what i clear nothing more than the shortest - term possible political advantage. why did the justice secretary go along with this? did the welsh secretary twist hi arm? did the secretary of state for culture, media and sport pull rank on him? i find it comprehensible why somebody with the common sense of the secretary of state would decide to go down that road, and i feel truly sorry for him. no, i real must make progress. the liberal democrat have table amend to g the public a choice on the proportional presentation system that the liberal democrat have long and consistent campaign for. a i said a moment ago, that system would lead to weak, unstable govern, to minority party hold the balance of power on a tiny fraction of the vote, and to extensive parliamentary presentation for madmen and extremist. the liberal democrat have support pr for a very long time, but i long ago realised that in matte of rationality the liberal democrat do not surface very much. this i the issue: amend will be put to the vote late and defeat. i forge myself for turn to a role of prophecy, but i think that i can say with some certainty that the amend i go absolute nowhere. what then are those hon gentlemen from the liberal democrat go to do? how on earth are they go to justify vote for a system that i less proportionate than first past the post? i heard the hon member for eastleigh, their home affair spokesman, say early today that they would support the alternate vote system in the referendum because it represent "" baby step "" toward proportional presentation. it i no wonder the prime minister think that the liberal democrat were born yesterday. time aft time, the liberal democrat are succoured by broken promise of electoral form, but there may be another reason for their support. again, if we turn to the ready - reckoner in the ministry view, which the minister ha, we find that, although the alternate vote system i less proportionate overall, it would significant benefit just one other political party apart from labour. it would benefit - surprisingly - the liberal democrat, give them more seat. so they must think that we were born yesterday if they think that we are go to support such a proposal. there i no perfect system, although i am bound to say - no, there i not: there i no perfect system, and i defy the liberal democrat to argue that there i. i do not put it past them to try to run such an argument, which i look forward to, but i am singular convinced by it. first past the post deliver clarity; it i well establish in this country; and it enable electorate to get rid of member whom they do not want and express a clear choice. the alternate vote system, with which the liberal democrat are bee seduce, skew the result toward far great unfair than anything that first past the post could ever achieve. voter can make up their own mind, and i agree with the hon gentleman. voter are offer a clear series of choice to make, include whether they wish to vote tactical - something that liberal democrat specialise in. on the whole, that i not a major problem and, indeed, they benefit from tactical vote, a they readily admit. their by - election literature i all about tactical vote. how often have i seen "" on the liberal democrat can win here "" on election literature. the hon gentleman argument therefore ha no basis whatever. i f the secretary of state to hi son blog. ye, i do. i commend it to the right hon gentleman, because it highlight the fact that the govern have not chosen to g the electorate any viable choice in this bogus referendum. the on choice i between an establish system and a system that i so manifest flaw - except for the possible short - term advantage that it deliver - that it i not worthy of considerate. i have some sympathy with the liberal democrat, because, if the govern want to off a constitutional convention - style approach to the electorate, with a multiplicity of choice, the secretary of state argument might have some force. at the moment, however, it ha none, because what i bee offer i a short - term gimmick. no. may i commend to the secretary of state the word of hi hon friend the member for glasgow, sou? on hi blog of 19 november, he said, "" you know the b way of elect a labour govern? not through messy, sordid little deal with the minor party, but by winning more vote than the tories. that how they stay in power for most of the last century - by beat u in election; by offer the electorate policy that were more popular than our. "" clear, the prime minister ha given up on that strategy, but we should not be too surprise. the hon gentleman went on to say that "" we simply reinforce the notion... that we have nothing to off the voter but electoral calculate.

ordinated system i that school that challenge a child bee taken off for special support might deprive that child of bee in the classroom with the teach and, perhaps, have a better opportunity to learn. we must get the balance right between ensure vision and not have a monolithic livery that stop innovate, particular for the most vulnerable in our society who are too often fail. i mean no respect to the hon lady expertise or passe in this area, but she suggest that the exist academy make it hard for children with s to get in than other school. however, the on data that we have suggest that that i not true. she suggest that academy may block children with real s getting in and then false nominate children a have s afterward. she need to substantiate that, because it i a serious allegation and if true should be look to in more tail. it i a pleasure to participate in the bate. it was also a pleasure to hear the maid speech of my hon friend the member for penrith and the border and for sou basildon and east thurrock. both spoke in a fine fashion, and they will be an adorn to not on their constituency but the house. i want to start on the most posit note that i can. i think that we all agree that the current system for deal with special educational need i not appropriate. the - i use the word yesterday - "" pushy "" parent, certain the most articulate, are b able to get their children statemented and their need recognised. that i the current system, and people realise that it i not good enough. we heard from the hon member for north w durham, in another excellent contribute base on h year of experience, h explanation of the difficulty. the current system i broken. the minister ha promise a green paper in the autumn to look at the whole subject of special educational need. at that time, i hope that the house will have more time to reflect on, consider and possibly improve the policy. rush policy make doe not always help, particular when deal with low incidence s or something that i on the margin of the mainstream. although there are so many children with s, it remain to be tackle. i do not support amend 71, but i think that it may be look for an explanation from the minister of how the system will work. the hon member for north w durham, who will be an excellent member of the house and an excellent member of the select committee, talk about priority. that bring me to my favourite topic when deal with public service form: incentive. too often, we reorganise the system without fully understand the incentive that are in place for the various player in it. we serve an explanation from the minister. given hi ability, i know that we will get it. i want to hear how precise the incentive will work for school that at time resist parent who are try to do the b for their children, to the extent that on parent with the nous, money and self - confidence can challenge them and get their child statemented. what happen to the other? i want to hear how the system will work so that, follow the change, it doe not become worse. there i nothing obvious in the bill to make it worse, but i want a cohesive narrate from the minister about how the system will be better even before the green paper i produce. i want to be assure that it cannot possibly get worse. we cannot have more parent in that position. people come to u, a constituency mps, about all sort of topic. i can think of many constituent who are particular articulate, well educate and well place, and who have relative and friend in good position, yet they are still endless and unjust frustrate by a system that can often seem believably resistant to do the right the. whenever i meet those people and try to help them - sometime successful, sometime not - i reflect on the people who do not have their self - confidence, educate and ability. it i therefore incumbent on u to ensure that legislate create something that will be more just, not less. we need to hear that from the minister, a i know we will. i wish we had more time to reflect on the bill, and that member of the educate committee from both side of the house and other were in a better position to improve the bill, but we are where we are. the hon member for north w durham talk about the hard - end drift - perhaps it will be call the "" glass drift "" - and said that even when money goes in, it somehow drift away. that must be because of the pressure within the system: the way human bee work - those who do the job that she did in the past, parent and people in school - lead to money not go where people want it to go. it i therefore not enough for minister to wish the right outcome - all hon member wish the right outcome. rather, they must show that they understand the engineer of the system sufficient to deliver them. we are deal with the most vulnerable of our children, and we cannot have an already bad situate made worse inadvertent by minister in a hurry who do not have sufficient explanation. i am sure that that i not the case, but i would hate to think it was. we should not be blind by the sire to appear to be act if we are do the wrong the. there i always an opportunity cost and people always have to make judgment call. we need to know who make those call, what the pressure on them and their incentive are, and their accountability. it all come down to that, and understand what the accountability mechanism will be if there i a much - crease numb of free academy. i am grateful to the minister for that explanation. i assume that in reality, the "" secretary of state "" mean the young people learn agency. my understand i that the system, embryonic a they are, are probably not a good a they ought to be, and i assume that ypla office represent the secretary of state will do that work. i understand and accept the minister assurance, and i think the bill ha been improve, but i am try to work out how the pressure and incentive will work to ensure that the school admit fair and look aft s children in the appropriate way when the decision get all the way down to the school, the parent and the local authority office, who i quite a long way away from the ypla office. i am struggle to imagine what will happen at that level and to think that all the way through. i am grateful for the minister compliment, which was not flattery - if i had said that it was, he would have correct me. one of the issue in this bill, which the amend seek to draw out, i the system - wide imply of a grow numb of school - include free school and exist school - becoming dependent and taking away money current spent on their behalf by the local authority. those of u of a supply - side revolution, 1980s, turn the sick man of europe around position natural think that the will grow and they can be better direct by people close to the front line. however, we need an explanation, because school are not business and we need to understand how it will work. i wish to chide the minister gently, although he may not have been responsible, because the place that one would natural look for that explanation - it may be a by - duct of the last government approach - i the equalities impact assess. at the risk of upsetting my right hon and hon friend, i would criticise the hon member for gedling - i will pronounce hi constituency correct - because in many way he ha been too gentle about the equalities impact assess in the last couple of day. i think it i less adequate than he ha made it out to be. the equalities impact assess i rather thin. it provide fair information, but it try to put the b gloss on that information. given that this i an important document to accompany a flagship bill, i would not expect paragraph 22 to be repeat, in it entirety, a paragraph 24. i would not expect paragraph 23, which i quite long, to be split and repeat in it entirety a paragraphs 25 and 26. it would suggest that someone ha not even bother to read this so - call important equalities impact assess. at the end, i was wait for an assess of the system - wide impact and the long - term and profound imply of have lot of free school. but when i got there i found paragraph 31, which state: "" we believe that the academy programme i already work toward promote inclusion and equality to the benefit of all pupil in the programme. an adverse impact i likely "". well, thank you very much. that i not an adequate explanation of the possible system - wide impact of this bill. i know that we will have a master class and a tour de force explanation from the minister on the system - wide impact and why the bill will work, but the impact assess i adequate. i meant to be gentle about this than i have been -

he can then explain to me why, a so often, it i flaw. the sovereign would invite other party lead to see whether they could secure a stable majority and they would have those conversation even if parliament had been prorogue. if a group of party not then in the govern told h majesty - or hi majesty, on some future date - that they could form a stable govern and provide good evidence of that fact, and if the cabinet secretary were to advise that they were a stable govern, there i no reason why h majesty should not invite the lead of the party putt together that constellation to form a govern. at that point, that lead would be the prime minister and could kiss hand - all of that can happen without parliament bee involve. that lead would then be the prime minister and would be able to "" rerogue "" or "" unrogue "" - i do not know what the correct term i - and call parliament, thus cancelling prorogation, and put their govern to a vote of confidence. if they were successful, that would obviate the need for a further election. so i do not think that the logic of the argument made by the hon member for rhondda hold. the hon gentleman also make a strong argument and ha much great historical knowledge than i do. i would say on that if the bill become law, it will become a clear part of our constitutional arrangement that the expectation, the sire and the will of the people i that we have fix - term parliament last f year. therefore, should there be an interruption that l to a vote of no confidence in a govern and the prime minister came to the sovereign ask for h to rogue parliament, it would be clear to the sovereign, who would also receive advice from h advise, that there was a dang of frustrate the constitute and frustrate the will of the people for u to have election every f year. given that the prime minister would have lost a vote of confidence in this house - in the old day that would normal have automatically l to their no longer have a right to govern - i do not think it would be classify a the sovereign "" meddle "" in politic were she then to say that she would invite alternative if the prime minister could not tell h that he or she could form a stable govern without go to the people in an election. if the prime minister could not g h that assurance, it would be entire proper for the sovereign - h advise would tell h this - to see whether the parliament that had not run it full course did not contain an alternate stable govern who could be form and for h to invite the relevant lead of any such govern to kiss hand, become prime minister and resummon parliament to see whether they could win a vote of confidence. that i why the fear of the hon member for rhondda i not justify. in fact, a verse fear i involve. my hon friend put it far more succinct and better than i could. the key point i that there i nothing to stop that process happen just because parliament i prorogue. we do not stop exist or bee able to have conversation with each other, with h majesty advise or with senior member of the civil service because parliament i prorogue. we would still exist, we would still be mps and we would still be able to go through that process. of course i accept that, but it i not real what we are referring to. we are referring to non - legislate activity associate with form a govern. exact. him or me? i thank the hon gentleman, who ha thought about this for longer, more deep and in a more search way than i have, a i was invite to make this speech on a relative short time ago. my hon friend i right. there were moment in the previous parliament when we all might have wish that the party in govern had taken that route rather than impose on u the rather long, drawn - out demise that we all witness. i have a sense that we will probably not persuade the hon gentleman here and now, although i have eternal optimism that we will persuade him of everything in due course. let me move on to the solute pose by the hon member for rhondda, which, to my mind, i a flaw - though also a ingenious - a hi analysis of what he see a the problem with the bill. hi solute i that this house, and exclusive this house, would have the power to rogue. i believe that the house would adopt a solute and the speak would then rogue parliament. the problem i another circumstance that the opposite party have talk about. when a prime minister with a rather small majority in this house feel, in the middle of a f - year term, that everything i go frightful well, they might cynical decide to engineer a vote of no confidence that they would then instruct their member to vote for in order to bring the house down, to rogue and, more important, to have a further election. i have heard in early discussion that that vex and worry opposite member and the hon member for rhondda. sure, hi solute would fall prey to that ruse far more than happen under the current circumstance, when on the monarch can rogue parliament. if a prime minister who felt that everything was go frightful well and that if he had a quick election he could get a better majority could engineer a vote of no confidence by getting hi troop to support it, sure he could engineer a solute of the house to rogue just a cynical, wilfully and arbitrarily. doe not the hon gentleman proposal move the power of prorogation, which current sit in that special, rather hallow constitutional place of bee one of the few the that the sovereign doe, on to the floor of this house where it will become subject to all the machinate and swirl of this place and of ambitious prime minister try to secure a better majority? although i f huge to the hon gentleman great understand, he betray a lack of a feel for how this constitute of our work. the same criticism could be apply to some of hi other amendment. the whole point of our constitute i that it i organic and flexible, and that it develop over time. everything we do, every decision we make and every bill we pass slight shift and change the constitute. it i a not a rule - base constitute but a practice - base constitute. of course, there are rule - the parliament act, the salisbury convention and so on - but they develop and metamorphose a we use them. if i may, i would like to at least develop the argument enough for the hon gentleman to be able to fire it down good and proper. once we have passe this bill and create f - year parliament and the expectation that they are the norm for this country, the constitute will have change. the way in which the sovereign use h power to invite people to form government, to see whether they can win the confidence of this house, to rogue and to accept advice from a prime minister will change. we will all make the argument that it would be profound unconstitutional for a prime minister who had just lost a vote of no confidence to abuse hi power a the monarch sole advise to advise h to rogue a parliament. it would be absolute within the monarch right to say, "" i am fend the constitute. i am fend this new expectation that we should have f - year parliament by try to see whether there i somebody other than this lose, who ha just lost the confidence of the house, who can command a majority. that doe not interfere with parliament or govern - i am in fact interpret proper the will of the people, which i that we should have f - year term. "" i believe that the hon member for rhondda think that these rule are changing and unbend and that they will not shift and metamorphose in response to the bill. the hon gentleman i cunning, a ever. fortunate, in almost all hi intervention in this bate - and in any other - he tend to argue that this house represent the sovereign will of the people, so it i a bit rich for him to shift ground and sudden say that if something was not cuss in an election campaign, it did not receive the endorse of the people. we are sufficient and entire to ourselves, cap of represent the will of the people. if we decide, a i believe and hope we will, that we want to adopt this bill, and if the gentlemen and lady in the other place decide that they would prefer to have slight more sleep and approve the bill, we will have decide - we are the will of the people - that this i how we want our constitute to operate in future. i do not accept the hon gentleman ingenious objection. the question that ha been ask doe not relate to the clause or the amendment and i f always to you, mr deputy speak, a to whether my comment would be relevant, although of course i want to be courteous to my hon friend. i think we will stick with new clause 4. thank you, mr deputy speak, from the bottom of my heart. a i hear in the distance the light pop of the second bottle bee open in no. 10 down street, i shall move on to other amendment in the group. the hon member for rhondda ha talk about tidy up. "" tidy "" i a great word, particular when spoken in the imitable accent not of the valet, but of the valley. i rather share hi love of the word, but not the concept. it i an entire classic labour action to try to make everything neat and tidy. hi further amendment would tidy up and specify when parliament would turn aft a general election, but he ha not told u why or when this ha been a problem in the past. he never said, "" there was that famous time when something happen in the country and we were not able to cuss it because we had not turn, "" or, "" there was that famous time when the prime minister did not want to do pmqs and avoid them because she or he was so terrify. "" he ha not given any reason to explain why the are not work at the moment, so this i one of the rare occasion on which i shall associate myself with the deep instinct of my hon friend the member for north east somerset that we should not change the unless they are demonstrably broken. that i an even more ingenious attempt, mr deputy speak, because it i hard for me to appeal to you for succour on this point, but i reject my hon friend's point because i believe that the bill i one of principle. i believe that the idea of prime minister pick the date of election i wholly outrageous in a modern democracy and that we must have fix - term parliament. i happen to know that this argument ha been rag inside the conservative, liberal democrat and labour party for year, so it i a cause of high principle. the history of the british constitute i that change of high principle happen on when the party in power see political advantage in such change; that i how democracy work. britain ha been form when the great cause have been align with low party interest and i thank - i am not sure if i am allow to say what i was go to say - the star that in this parliament at this time that alliance of high principle and low politic ha come together and that we are putt through parliament a bill that will establish fix - term election and move the prime minister right to choose a date that i to hi or h advantage. i detect from the hon gentleman expression and demeanour that he i worry, but he should not be because we genuine want the change to become permanent - a much a the constitute of our country can allow that. we genuine want there to be, at least for a long a any of u can see, a habit, norm and expectation deep in our society that there will be election in may every f year. i hope that i how the situate will be perceive in this country aft the bill i passe - without my hon friends' amendment. i am very grateful to my hon friend - may i call him that? i feel a though we are friend even though we sit on opposite side. i am always nervous about the custom of this place: i want to say thank god; i meant thank god; and frank the star have absolute nothing to do with it. i am happy to be correct. turn to the tidy of the amend of the hon member for rhondda, he ha not demonstrate, or even provide a shred of evidence to explain why the current point at which parliament i call aft an election i a problem or cause any difficulty. we should reject hi amend. the hon gentleman ha table another amend to regulate the timetable for election and he ha again made a superficial appeal argument about line up the different election timetable for different ti of govern, but it will not have escape the attention of govern member that he ha, a ever, line up with the longer figure. that betray the deep belief of the labour party, of which the hon gentleman provide a good example, that what the country need are more politic, longer election campaign, more leaflet go through door and more people knock on one door just when eastenders i on or when a good game ha start. i agree entire. i am not sure i understood that point, so, in a traditional tory way, i am go to reject it because the hon gentleman said it. the issue i whether the timetable should form to the low figure of 17 day or the high figure of 25 day. my instinct, and probably that of most govern member, i that any conformity should be to a short election campaign and a quick decision. however, we must then address the issue of whether it i appropriate to determine that figure in this bill. i believe that the bill make a fundamental constitutional change - to that extent i agree with those of my hon friend who are uncomfortable with part of it - but that i why i support it. i want that fundamental constitutional change and i want it to remain for ever. i want it to be something that people will scribe in 25 or 30 years' time a one of the big constitutional shift in the life of modern britain. because the bill will make such a fundamental constitutional change, i do not want to hang about with all sort of little, pernickety tidy - up exercise. i do not want to lumber the bill with measure that might seem irrelevant in future, thereby open the door to further amend. i want the bill to have a few clause a possible - clear clause that are base on the principle position that the time of an election should not be up to the prime minister but should be a matte of rhythm and pattern define by our constitute. i thank the right hon gentleman and i agree with him. if we are to have, a i hope we will, election fall in a regular pattern, coincide with other election to other important democratic body, it seem obvious that there should be a consistent series. otherwise, people would find it very fuse if local election campaign had start while the parliamentary election campaign they all knew was come had not. in such a situate, if party put out leaflet with councillors on one side and a parliamentary candidate on the other, they might get to trouble for jump the gun. the point he make i absolute right, but we should not necessarily decide here and now, in this bill, between the proposal for 17 or 25 day, or even that the length should be 17 or 25 day. if we want to make this change, should we not think a bit hard about what the period should be? i have on thought of it on the spur of the moment, but i think i could make a very strong case for 12 day, and if someone want to enter to a bit of a dutch auction and say eight day, i would be happy with that too. the hon gentleman i bee a trifle kind because he knew i was bee a little light - hearted and frivolous; indeed he indulge himself in such behaviour. whereas we allow him to get away with it, he ha taken my light - hearted conjecture a a serious suggestion. what he ha done, however, i to demonstrate the force of my argument, which i that we should have a proper discussion, separate from the bill, about the question, "" what i the right time period? "" there are many good counter - argument; the hon gentleman ha enumerate some of them. my sympathy for those prison deny their right to vote are more limit than my sympathy for the other category of potential postal voter that he mention, but i am sure that those prison too will have their fend. should we not have a separate bate on a separate piece of legislate on this question - if legislate i require? maybe it i require, but i do not think that we should be make this amend to a bill that need to stand the test of time. it need to re a a keystone in our constitute that last through the age and i not erode by time. i hope, therefore, that everyone in the house will choose to reject the new clause and the amendment pose by the hon gentleman.",0,0.158,0.259,1

my right hon friend the secretary of state spoke about that. the right hon member for bracknell was right when he said that such matte must pose difficult problem for the secretary of state, a they did for lord mayhew. decisions about lease and attempt to form an overall view of the situate cannot be easy. such matte must be given the same considerate and accord the same weight, and the understand of my right hon friend's judgment must be the same, a that which was given when we were in opposite when the then secretary of state, in exact the same situate, introduce the bill that was to become the northern ireland act. that i the least that we should be entitle to expect from the right hon member and hi right hon and hon friend. perhaps i may be allow to finish this point. far from it. we are not compare like with like. we are bate the wisdom or otherwise of lease prison, something which happen under the northern ireland act and i likely to happen under the current legislate. while intern, which was the biggest recruit sergeant that the provisional ira ever had, was still on the statute book, it was my duty to try to alter the government attitude and to tell my colleague that we had to do it. if we had time, i could go through the other blunder that were committed by the previous govern and that help ira recruit. bloody sunday i one that immediate spring to mind, and there were other. when i list to opposite member, i sometime feel that perhaps they do not want the belfast agree to succeed. i also sometime think that they are strike pose in relate to that agree because, if their proposal were carry through, the whole edifice would fall. i understand that from the dissident unionist, from the democratic unionist party and from the unite kingdom unionist party, but the attitude that ha been taken by h majesty opposite on this matte seem specifically design to weak the whole of the belfast agree and to bring it down. the right hon member for bracknell i sitting there with a sneer on hi face and mutter away. i see. from the comfort of a sedentary position, the opposite spokesman on northern ireland can twitter away but, when challenge, he i not prepare to say anything. i come back to the point that i start on. my right hon friend ha had to take an important decision. it serve the support of the whole house. it cannot have been easy for h, but the success of the belfast agree pend on that decision success and on h judgment of those matte, a do so many other the. before u i a list of the four organisations that have yet to abandon violence; i think that we can all agree on that point. i use the word "" yet "" because i am basically an optimist and i sincere hope that, in the months to come, they may conceivably g up violence, with the other organisations, and wake up to the political realities of the 1990s. evidence i abundant that the one way to make progress in northern ireland i to participate peaceful in the duct of northern irish politic. we can all agree that those who still seek to mote themselves through violence should not benefit from the peace. again, i do not imagine that there i a single person in the chamber who would question that point, or the fact that, if they do not accept the agree, the agree cannot accept them. however, i am confident that the list that ha been drawn up by the secretary of state for northern ireland was base on comprehensive advice from the general office command and the chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary. i am also confident that the secretary of state view i that the right organisations have been include and the right organisations exclude. in simple term, it i a rather poor demonstrate of bad faith for anyone in this chamber to question the idea that the secretary of state ha sincere attempt to make the b decision that she possibly can with the information that she ha at h disposal. let u not pretend that we all have the same quality of information before u. the secretary of state, by the very nature of h job, ha access to more insightful and more tail information than other. i hear a conservative member say that that i absurd.",1,0.131,0.262,0.996

"" presumably, that was why the conservative manifesto and the coalition programme both state: "" we will stop the top - down reorganisations of the nhs "". they claim that their pose form are not top - down, but i cannot think of anything more top - down than an act of parliament set out in 353 page and 61,344 word, and yet it i still a broken promise. the nhs, a we all know, i do better than ever before: wait list have come down dramatically; wait time have been massive reduce; and survival rate are dramatically improve. most people, in most place, and most of the time, are getting a very good deal from the heal service, which i why it i more popular than ever before. no, i do not have time. those improvement have come about not a a result of any structural change, but because the labour govern put to the nhs more money than ever before, built more new hospital than ever before, put in more new equipment and, above all, recruit cord numb of doctor and nurse. we also put more emphasis on standard and on try to ensure that we spread b practice right across the heal service. i accept that we need more clinician involve in decision make, but we do not need to go to gp commission to bring that about. all we need do i get more of them on primary care trust with more influence there. why i it just fine to gps? there i no reference to great involve of hospital specialist and there i nothing in the 61,000 - odd word about give hospital doctor a bigger say, and they have some expertise in these matte. many gps, a we know, do not support the proposal, and many of them want to get on with just bee doctor. one great deception that i bee promote i say to patient, "" you and your gp will decide where you will get treat.

442,"may i take the secretary of state back to hi state about single - member presentation? i he pose to abolish multi - member ward in local govern? i thank the hon and learn gentleman for give way because he ha just given away my party whole case, which i that proportionality and fair are the same the. if he doe not believe that, why doe he care about the point that the hon member for gainsborough made? i am sorry that i do not agree with either of the point that the right hon member for birkenhead made. that i usual for me, because usual i agree with hi point. the first was that under preferential vote system, people effective have more than one vote. that i not the case, because a the hon member for battersea point out, they have one vote but are effective ask what they would do with it if their first - preference candidate were not stand. that i call tactical vote, which happen all over the country in every general election, but in a preferential vote system it i done more formal and rational, and people do not have to guess. the right hon gentleman second point was in favour of the french system. i am sorry that i cannot follow him on that either, even though, unlike the hon member for stroud, i am general a great admire of all the french. the electoral system in france ha had an fortunate effect not just on it politic but on it culture and way of life, because it ha split the whole country to two large camp of left and right. france suffer constant from that, and we should not go down that route. it would have the effect - perhaps many member would welcome this - of taking u back to a bipolar system that i very difficult to break to. it i very difficult for new view to come through in such a system. it seem to me that the hon and learn member for beaconsfield had on one argument, which defeat hi own case. it was that he was against av because it could be less proportional than first past the post, which i true. if he accept that argument, he should therefore accept that a the single transferrable vote system, for example, i more proportional than first past the post, it i better and fair accord to hi own argument. the conservative case therefore seem self - contradictory. i am try to member the start of the intervention. it seem to me that one cannot argue that first past the post balance the advantage of disproportionality and the advantage of decisive in such a well calibrate way that any movement either way i obvious wrong. that doe not make any sense, especial a everyone admit that we cannot tell precise the degree to which av would make a difference. we cannot answer that question, because preferential vote i like tactical vote but carry on in a different, more organised way. if tactical vote i unwound and people start to vote for their first preference, they will be vote in a way that they do not now. that i why it i perfect reason to say that we do not know what the effect of the av system would be. there are two point to consider in the hon lady question. the first i whether the single transferrable vote would break the constituency link, which it would not. it would just mean that there were more member p constituency. it would break the one member, one constituency link. for 17 year i was a local councillor and there were three member in my ward, but i did not feel that that meant i represent the people in my ward less. in fact, when a member of another party represent the ward for a few year, it crease competition between the party in the ward and made u all better representative. the hon lady second point was about the jenkins commission's proposal, which was a political compromise but not one that we have to stay with for ever. it ha a great numb of advantage. first, it would set up two entire different sort of member - the constituency member and the list member. there would be an overlap of responsibility between the two, but they would have very different mandate, which would lead to difficulty. second, because the county seat would be so small - the list would not be national; they would relate to very small region by the standard of most regional list system - the proposal would create the most extraordinary conflict of interest between av - elect member and county list member. it would be in the interest of a list member if hi or h party colleague lost in the constituency seat, which doe not seem particular sensible from the point of view of political party or coherent govern. i cede that it i a better system than first past the post, but a lot of the problem are about how big or small the electoral region are. the large they are, the less problem there i with the overlap between the job of the two sort of member, and the less it i in the interest of list member that people on their own side are defeat in the constituency election. it come a no great surprise that my great lead mr. lloyd george was accuse of cynicism on occasion, but nevertheless there i equal cynicism in the conservative party, which argue for first past the post solely because it gain such a proportionate advantage from it. our proposal would do the same for the western isle, which i held by the scottish national party. in any circumstance, there are certain geographical limit to the size of a seat. that i why, in any preferential system, there must be a range in the size of constituency. one can have bigger seat in urban area while retain a sense of represent a geographical area than one can in rural area, especial the thin populate marine area of the sort the hon gentleman mention. on the whole, the proportionality of the stv system come from urban area, because there are large numb of member in those seat. that ha always been the case. the proposal in 1916 was precise that there should be stv in the city and av in the countryside, so it i not new. although new clause 88 i far from perfect, for reason that i will seek to explain, and although we will seek to amend it radical, we will support it in the lobby, at least so that it i read a second time. accord to the rather peculiar procedure of this committee - compare, for example, with local govern - the on way one can press an amend to the new clause to a division i if the new clause i read a second time. why are the govern pose a referendum between av and first past the post, and not between the latte and a more proportional system? to that extent, i agree with what conservative member have been say. in a second. why have the govern come to pose such form so late in the day? it look like a manoeuvre to me - a death - b verse. in cambridge in 1997, i was obvious identify by the labour party a a lib dem voter - i was a lib dem councillor, so i suppose i was rather easy to spot. i receive a target letter from the labour candidate - all party send them - who express h undying support for a referendum on electoral form. she ask me to vote tactical for h on the ground that a labour govern would deliver electoral form, or at least a referendum on it. i did not believe h, and given that 13 year late, no referendum ha happen, i am incline to the view that i was right not to do so. i suspect that the reason why the prime minister ha come round to promote a referendum again i precise so that labour candidate can send out more of the same kind of letter. this time, i suspect i will not be the on one not to believe them. we will vote for amend to govern new clause 88 so that the referendum i between first past the post and a proportional system. what will we do if that i defeat? although the new clause i a very small step in the right direction, there are two truths. first, change the electoral system i on the political agenda, which i a big and important point for u. second, av i a preferential system, which we are in favour of. the system we support - stv - i a preferential system, but it just happen to be proportional a well. no. we should just get on with do the right the, which i to move to a fair electoral system that i proportionate and preferential. the hon gentleman exaggerate the extent to which av i proportionate or worse than first past the post - sometime it i, but not always. a i said a few moment ago, it i very difficult to predict the effect of av, because first - preference vote will change. for u, it look like progress, even if it i a small amount of progress, because it i precise what the hon gentleman say: a preferential system. that i a small gain, but one worth have. i fear, sir alan, that if i stray to that bate, i will be brought up short very quick. the hold of a referendum i not in itself a particular mass gain. i do not member there bee a referendum to bring in first past the post - it i the start point simply because it i the status quo. there i a bias in favour of it simply because it i there. i should like to mention one the about the prime minister. i heard what the hon and learn member for beaconsfield said about the prime minister previous view on electoral form and i agree with the former position. that i another reason why i suspect the proposal i a manoeuvre. the hon and learn gentleman referred to the diary of lord ashdown. i appear in those diary, especial in volume 2, with a degree of accuracy for which i would not entire vouch. nevertheless, it was true at that time that the prime minister was seen a a fundamental block to form. but, a my hon friend the member for somerton and frome point out in the bate on the money solute, the question before u i not whether the proposal come from a cynical or a bad source, it i whether the idea itself i worth support. it i true, however - i fully cede this - that av ha a large numb of advantage. it i not very proportionate. it can be less proportionate, but proportionality i, for u, an important measure. it doe not seem to be an important measure for the conservative when they support first past the post, and i am glad to welcome them to the camp of those who believe that proportionality i an important aspect of fair in an electoral system. it i true that very few seat proportional would have change hand under av at the last election, if we make certain assumption about whether people would have vote for their first preference in the same way and what their second preference would have been. in the end, however, there i one advantage to av, which i that it end tactical vote. the hon member for glasgow, sou was of the view that liberal democrat are the main beneficiary of tactical vote - the hon gentleman say from a sedentary position that av formalises tactical vote. what it doe i end the need for tactical vote because people can vote in their real order of preference and do not have to guess about a situate in which they are vote for their four choice in order to keep out their fifth choice. that i an enormous advance for the legitimacy of the electoral system, because people are express their real political view in a way that they have not done for many decade. i can assure the hon gentleman that there i no such pact now. the av system i not proportionate, it doe not allow a choice of candidate between member of the same party, and it still allow safe seat. those, for u, are major advantage. stv, the system that we pose in amend, solve all those problem. stv i simply av in multi - member constituency, but it i far more proportionate. the result overall from northern ireland, for example, show a very high degree of proportionality, even in seat with four or f member. the scottish local govern verse i less proportionate. that i because it use small seat with small numb of member. in practice, across the whole country, if there were constituency with between one and six member, the result would be a very high degree of proportionality. what i the advantage of proportionality? that i at the heart of the bate about whether we should move to a proportional system, a oppose to av, and at the heart of the problem of legitimacy. that i why the secretary of state was right to mention legitimacy. it i not a peripheral issue. the real problem with our politic i that this place i political unrepresentative. it i so unlike the politic of the country that people do not recognise it. people here do not think so, but they wouldn't, would they? the situate i like that before the form act of 1832. the member in that parliament thought they were perfect representative and there was no reason for form. but we cannot go on with a political system under which unpopular government are elect by a little more than a third of those vote and push through policy that two third of those vote have just vote against. the government of this country - all of them - are unpopular the day they are elect. the sentiment i express through a affection with politic and a hatred of politician. to see the effect of that, we must go back to what happen aft the start of the iraq war. million march and then said, "" but the politician paid no attention to u. "" that i where the dang i for our politic a it i current set up. that i a very good point. the hon gentleman i right. first past the post did not work even in it own term. the one the that i said about it i that it allow electorate to throw government out. one often hear that argument, but even that i not true. in the last eight election since october 1974, on six occasion the majority of those vote have vote to kick the govern out, yet found on the day aft the election that the same govern were still in office. a proportional system cannot have a worse cord than that. so the argument work the other way round a well. the secretary of state made an important and serious point about the function of general election. it i a point that i should deal with before conclude. he said that in election for elect an execute, it was important to have a decisive system, whereas in election for a more representative body which was not involve in execute decisions, a less decisive, more proportional system was appropriate. that i the heart of the problem - we cannot carry on with the myth that a general election i about elect a govern from party compete on the basis of their manifesto and then claim a mandate to govern. that i fine when the winning party ha 45 or 50 p cent. of the vote, but it make little sense to anyone when the winning party ha 35 p cent. of the vote. that i even lay aside the fact - obvious to everyone in politic - that no one outside the political bubble read manifesto. there i no mandate. the mandate to govern that the current govern claim, on the basis of their majority in this house, i illusory, and the public know that. the hon gentleman demonstrate the obvious fault that i mention - the party did not win the support of the public on the basis of their manifesto, because no one read the manifesto in the first place. it i a myth. what happen in country with proportional system i that, ye, the party get together to try to create a govern with majority support - and that ha some chance of have the moral authority to govern. we do not have government with that moral authority now. i wish that i could g that assurance. manifesto are main for internal consumption - that i the reality that people do not seem to be willing to accept. manifesto also lay out for the civil service the likely programme of a party. however, we must get away from these myths if we are to win back the trust of the public. that i the central point, and that i why the secretary of state was right to raise the point about what we are elect to this house to do. i do not think that we are elect an execute: we are elect a representative legislature. that i a fundamental point that divide people. however, even if we were elect an execute, first past the post doe that very bad in a multi - party system, and result in government who are so lack in legitimacy that we should vise our opine of first past the post even in that case. i do not consider more than a fifth of the vote to be a small numb of vote. it doe not follow that a party in second or third place i automatically in govern. the hon gentleman say that we do not have a tradition of grand coalition, but that i because we have first past the post. under a different system, we would have a grand coalition fair often, because of the similarity of view on many subject between the two party. my hon friend i right that the bate here i often extraordinarily parochial. the idea that one can point to individual country - italy versus germany, for example - to prove one way or the other that a system doe not work i very simplistic. look at more broad, no obvious objection to a more proportional system can be drawn from international comparison. however, we need to look at the political situate in this country now, and how change the electoral system could g our government more legitimacy than they have had for many year. the hon gentleman argument i more on my side than on hi. a we already have coalition within party, would it not be better to make that more explicit and have a political system in which the public can see the different political view that are bee put to the formation of a govern? the amendment that we pose fall to two group. some are associate with amend and have to do with the date of the pose referendum. the other set of amendment come under the rubric of amend, which i all about the topic that we have been cuss so far - whether the referendum should be between av and first past the post or stv and first past the post. amend pose stv instead of av. it i an argument for an stv referendum that those of u who are prepare to vote for an av referendum tonight are not entire enthusiastic about it. would it not be better to have a referendum between first past the post, which ha some enthusiast here, and a different electoral system, which ha many enthusiast here? a referendum between two compete view that have enthusiasm behind them i likely to have a high turnout and engage the public more than a referendum in which that i not the case. the govern have to decide whether they real want to have this referendum or whether this i, a other hon member have imply, simply an exercise in gesture politic or even a case of sett up an opportunity to send out target letter. if the govern were real serious about the proposal, they would be sett it up so that an come conservative govern could on verse the duty to have a referendum by a full act of parliament. new clause 88 mean that it will be possible for an come govern simply to pose the necessary statutory instrument and then defeat it use their majority. at that point, the entire duty to hold a referendum appear. by have the date of the referendum way to next year, it i possible to move the duty to have a referendum by use the parliament act, without have a majority in both house. the effect of amend would be to change the date by which there must be a referendum to may next year, so that, because of how the parliament act work, inevitably it would be less than 13 months from the second read of any peal bill. a peal bill could not, therefore, be force through use the parliament act. this i a test for the govern. i admit that on amend, on which i would very much like to divide the committee, there seem to be an obvious political difference about which electoral system to adopt and put to the referendum - av or stv. there are clear differences of view on that. however, amend i about a different issue, on which i would also like to divide the committee, if the opportunity arise. it i about whether the govern real are serious about this or just play game. i very much hope that they are not play game and that this i a serious proposal. rose - i will go first. the right hon and learn gentleman ha said that it i difficult, or even impossible, for dependent member to be elect under proportional system. that i entire untrue of the single transfer vote. the irish experience ha been that it i quite straightforward for dependent member to be elect, even dependent member who have belled against their party.",1,0.181,0.258,1

445,"it i a great pleasure to follow the right hon member for sou shield. i am light to be able to speak in support of the bill, because i believe that it respond to some of the issue that have been affect my constituency for the past doz or so year. i want to focus on two element of it in the relative limit time avail to me. the first concerns the influence of gps. like many hon member, i hold constituency surgery, and bare a week goes by without one of my constituent come to me with an issue about the national heal service. few of my constituent understand the inn machinate of the nhs, but the vast majority of their complaint are direct toward hospital and treatment, and the way in which treatment i commission. for those with some knowledge of how the system work, it i clear that the problem lie with one of the three organisations that serve worcestershire - the acute hospital trust, the primary care trust and the mental heal partnership - and the way in which they interface with each other. however, what my constituent never complain about i their gp - well, they do not. most of the problem lie in the fact that the chain of livery of service i too complicate. for a gp to commission service for their patient, their wish must cross not one but two organisational interface, at the very least. that doe not make any sense. anyone design a complex system try to instil the high possible level of simplicity so that opportunity for mistake are kept at a minimum. my local gps, far from fear change, have welcome and embrace the new proposal set out in the white paper. when i met them last september, they had already form a shadow consortium serve my constituent. they are enthusiastic to take on the responsibility of commission, and they were appoint not to have been chosen a one of the initial pathfinder consortia. that ha now been remedy with the second tranche, with the wyre forest consortium bee chosen to act a pathfinder. it i in the second aspect of the bill that i have a specific interest. hon. member will be acute aware of the issue surround kidderminster hospital and the change that affect it in the ear year of the previous govern. what start a a removal of blue - light service from our hospital end up a a downscaling from district general hospital to a mere treatment centre with a minor jury it, although i must say that the treatment centre i now well like local. at the time, there was huge test at this outrage. public opine was dead against the downscaling, with local resident march in force against it, a human chain bee form around the hospital to protect it and final, and most dramatically, an extraordinary result in the 2001 general election when the people of wyre forest demonstrate their anger in the strong way possible by vote at the ballot box to save kidderminster hospital. but still they were not listen to, and the hospital was downscaled. short aft i was select a the candidate in wyre forest in january 2004, i arrange the first of many visit from the then shadow secretary of state for heal, now the secretary of state. i want him to come to kidderminster to hear at first hand how angry local resident were at not bee listen to. he came on many occasion and listen to the staff, to patient group, to doctor and to nurse. indeed, he ha come so often that he i now on first name term with the two matron at kidderminster. he i a very popular fellow, i can tell you. he ha also been to other hospital face closure and downscaling, and he seem to have listen to them a well, because the second key element in this bill i the proposal for local heal and wellbeing board and the local democracy that they will bring. i am grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring that up. if my predecessor were that upset about the proposal, it would have been good of him to get in touch with hi member of parliament and voice hi concerns to me directly. he ha not done that. he i, however, a man for whom i have a great deal of respect, and hi view are worth listen to, although i would not necessarily agree with him on this point. when i look at the bill, i ask myself a fundamental question. if these vision had been in place aft 1997, would kidderminster hospital have been downscaled? i am confident that it would not. these proposal clear have the full and enthusiastic support of my local gps, who are willing, ready and able to take on these new responsibility. i and they believe that the bill will result in a more responsive nhs that list to local people in deliver local solute to local problem. final, i can say to my constituent in wyre forest, who are still angry because they thought that they were ignore for a decade, that they are bee listen to, that it was the conservative opposite who listen to their plight, and that it i their anger at bee ignore and the response to that anger that lie at the heart of the bill.",1,0.121,0.257,0

i want to make some construct comment, and i hope that the minister will take on board some of the issue i raise. i will ask some question from a northern ireland perspective, because the house benefit change will affect u a well - we cannot divorce ourselves or walk away from them. i should set the scene, because northern ireland ha some very particular circumstance: the department for social develop ha responsibility for social security benefit, and the department for employ and learn ha responsibility for train and employ programmes, in contrast with the re of the unite kingdom and the department for work and pension. del ha significant differences with it step to work programme, a against the job guarantee fund here. there are issue to be clarify, therefore, and i want to ensure that the change in benefit will not impact adverse on the people of northern ireland. northern ireland ha had the local house allowance since 2008, but it ha not been formal assess. i had hop that it would be, because it would have given u an idea of how successful it ha been. i am concern, however, that the pose change to the allowance lack a firm evidential base. will the minister com on that? i think that the proposal will adverse affect recipient in northern ireland. i am grave concern about the budget plan to reduce the initial award of the benefit by 10 % in april 2013 to those claimant who have been receive jobseeker's allowance for longer than 12 months. i make that com because the employment rate in northern ireland between april and june was 6. 6 %. worse still, the work - age employ rate remain well below the uk average, and was the low of all the 12 uk region. the change put forward tonight will adverse affect the people of northern ireland because of our position in relate to benefit. i have concerns about the introduction of a measure that utilises sanction that are neither helpful nor beneficial. the proposal appear to be base on the assumption that a reduction in house benefit will motivate work - age claimant to find work, but it i clear that even if every work - age claimant was so motivate, there would still be significant numb of long - term unemployed people in northern ireland beyond 2013. perhaps the minister will com on that. we have to find a balance. how do we distinguish between those who are genuine seek employ and those who perhaps are not? i mention early that the focus of house benefit ha to be on provide low - come family with access to good - quality house. the house benefit cap rate may have a knock - on effect on the social house sector, a private rent accommodate become hard to access for those on low come and the demand for social house crease. a great many people are in a catch - 22 situate: they do not have enough money to rent a house private, yet there i not enough social house for them. i thank my hon friend for hi information, which i helpful in focus attention on what we are try to aim for. member have mention fuel poverty. one of the spin - offs of lose house benefit will be fuel poverty. in my former position, i sat a a member of the northern ireland assembly. one of the inquiry that we undertook was on child poverty. fuel poverty and house benefit both came up in that inquiry to child poverty, but all those the were part of the jigsaw of how people survive. take away one part of it and we have a problem. i have some concern about that. one member mention the discretionary house pay, and i would certain be keen to find out from the minister what he tend to do if the pool of fund that i set aside run out. he said that it was impossible to separate house benefit from house and social develop policy in general, and there are some example of that in northern ireland where house ha been design to bring mix community together, such a in loughbrickland in county down and ballynafeigh in sou belfast, which are also example of how we have move forward. i would like to express some concern over the removal of house benefit from people where it will drive them toward poor area. for some people who are already in poor area, they will not move beyond them, and i have concerns about that. i am conscious of the time, but another concern of mine relate to apply by car for disable people - i do not think that the issue ha been mention fully yet, although some member may have partial touch on it. a car for a disable person might want to apply, but the on person who can do so i the claimant spouse or partner. would it not be more beneficial to ensure that the re of the family member, who are perhaps those who are more affect, may also apply? i look forward to hear the minister response to that. i also believe that some considerate need to be given to single parent who have share custody of children. i am not sure whether that issue ha been address, so i would ask the minister to look at that, too. where custody i establish, benefit entitlement should be grant to the parent to support the family it. i do not believe that the proposal do that. again, i ask the minister to consider that point. other member have touch on the issue of large family. it would not apply so much in the area that i represent, but i believe that it none the less apply right across the unite kingdom. ha particular considerate been given to ethnic family in other part of the unite kingdom, where large, multi - generational household are perhaps more common?

481,"it i a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this bate, miss begg. i want to focus on the practical issue, a we have heard quite a lot of constitutional theorising, and, indeed, a great deal of fascinate history. when i first saw these proposal, i assume, perhaps rather naive, that the govern had simply made a big mistake, and that they had not realised that, a a result of go for f - year fix - term parliament with immediate effect - that i, in relate to the length of this parliament - the date of the general election would coincide with the scottish parliamentary election, the welsh assembly election and the northern ireland assembly election. i thought that once they realised that that was a problem they would rethink their position, if on in pure practical term and even if there were a theoretical argument for f year bee better than four - and i have certain not heard one today - but they did not do so. my hon friend the member for dunfermline and w fife said that he hop that when the minister summed up the bate - on third read, of course, the bate may be summed up by the deputy prime minister himself - he would take some of those issue on board, but i fear that, if the previous constitutional bill i anything to go by, that will not happen. the deputy prime minister could have written hi summing - up speech for the third read of that bill before the bate had even start. indeed, i believe that he had, given that so little reference was made to the hour spent in committee and the different argument that had been put at that stage. it seem that none of those argument had been listen to. i appreciate that many govern member have no experience of the practical issue that we have raise. there i, aft all, on one conservative member of parliament who represent a scottish seat. there are scots who represent other seat, but there i on one conservative mp who doe so, and a far a i am aware he ha not been present much during our bate or contribute much to them. some junior member of the coalition - the junior partner - represent scottish seat, but they too have been fair conspicuous by their absence for much of the bate. however, the hon member for edinburgh w ha now arrive, and the hon member for east dunbartonshire was briefly present early. i accept the hon lady point that the minister cannot take part in the bate, but i have not observe a great deal of discussion in the wide press, here or in scotland, to which he ha contribute. the point that i was make, however, i that many govern member have no practical experience of the position that obtain in 2007. i think that govern member are incline to make light of it and to imagine that we are stirring up a storm in a teacup over something that did not real matte, but it was important. it was a bad day for democracy when so many the went wrong with that combine election. ye, it did have something to do with the sign of the form; i am not go to say that it did not, for the sign did not help. however, the real issue in that text, which was address aft 2007, was the couple of the local govern and scottish govern election, with an arrange to ensure that that would not happen again. it seem odd to voter in scotland, and certain to political activist there, that we are not just turn to the position in which we found ourselves in 2007, but, i would argue, putt ourselves in a considerably worse position. although this will not simply be a matte of practicality, i should like to draw attention to some of the practicality of which govern member may not be aware. the boundary relate to the scottish parliament and the westminster constituency are now very different. they have move apart because the numb of scottish constituency represent here was reduce in 2005. the scottish parliament boundary have been change very recent. their size ha not been reduce and the numb have not change, but there ha been a substantial redraw which, in most case, ha move them even further from the westminster boundary. there are some very strange boundary, make it difficult for people to understand who represent them and what constituency they are in. people who live in the southernmost part of the constituency of my hon friend the member for edinburgh sou for westminster purpose will be in edinburgh eastern for the purpose of the scottish parliamentary election next year. given that they live in the far sou of edinburgh, they find it quite difficult to fathom why they have effective been transport to a different part of the city. that will cause not just a potential for electoral fusion, but serious practical problem relate to the organisation of the election. even more important i the blurring and fuse of the real political differences that have emerge since devolution. i am sure that the same apply to wale, although i probably do not know enough about it politic or history. no doubt my colleague will rush to enlighten me. our politic in scotland, however, have develop very different. not many of the political party represent in the scottish parliament take the line adopt by the coalition govern here. for stance, the coalition govern have decide that they want to stop fund the build of afford house through grant - i assure you that this point i relevant to the bate, miss begg - and instead to fund it by raise rent, which mean that tenant will pay for the build of their new home. i am absolute posit that no party represent in the scottish parliament, even the conservative party, will espouse such a position in scotland through the parliament. in the past - although the situate may change - all the party in the scottish parliament have sign up to free personal care for the elder. at that time a different view was taken at westminster, and a different view was taken by my party and by other. however, although some might find it surprise, the conservative in scotland have sign up to that policy in the past. i entire agree. that i another illustrate of where the difficulty lie. it i not that people are stupid. it i not that the voter cannot understand that there are two election ongoing. it i that the issue will not be proper bate, and there will be fusion about what the various party stand for. for example, scottish liberal democrat may, a ha been suggest, wish to campaign strong about the way they think university should be fund. a that i clear different from the position taken by their leadership here at westminster, they are go to find it much hard to get their point of view across. i was not suggest that it i either fuse in general term or wrong that party in different part of the unite kingdom should take different view. that ha also happen in wale, and it ha happen on heal issue and educate issue. it i right that we should develop in that way; i think it i extreme healthy. it i a sign of the strength and success of devolution since 1999 that there can be such differences of opine even within political party that are very close and see themselves a part of the same party. i absolute agree. the problem i not to do with people taking different position; it i to do with what will happen in the month or few week before an election when the issue are bee bate on the hustings and bee port in the newspaper. i have an awful vision of u running two set of hustings and try to get people to come out to slight chilly church hall to list to complete different bate on different night - although it i perfect possible to get people to come out to such event when election take place at different time. why make this happen when we do not have to? i thank my hon friend for that information, and i do not think that govern member appreciate that aspect. what we are talk about i not a local govern election that we might be face next year or in 2015. the election we are talk about are not less important than general election for people in scotland, because people in scotland consider the scottish govern to be the govern of the country for the purpose for which they have power. they are a govern: they have a first minister, a cabinet and a national aspect in the sense that they are the govern in a parliament that cover the part of the uk that i scotland. i am not try to ignore wale or northern ireland at all in this, and the same principle apply to them. if we respect what we have achieve through devolution, it i important that we do not allow that to be swamp. we have those different bate and policy, and people have their chance to vote different, which they do - i am not for a minute go to suggest that people will not vote different on the same day, because i know that that can happen. the genuine ability to separate out these area of politic and to allow each legislature it real place and presence within our constitute i simply bee ignore by these measure. a i have said, it seem to me that there i no reason for that. i agree with my right hon friend. yet again, that i another aspect of a situate that we are create. apparent - the hon member for epping forest let the cat out of the bag - this i bee done not for any good and strong constitutional reason or because we can argue about the history of the past 200 year, but because it suit this coalition govern to have this parliament last for f year. it suit them to have this vision wrapped up with the other part of the bill, which will be bate late, to try to ensure that the coalition hold together. this i bee wrapped up a a constitutional bill and it i bee present a something that will last to the future but, given our constitute, it i possible for a future parliament to change that, so we are not entrench the. i thank my hon friend for that information, because it add to the important case that we are present. the people who find this high amuse clear have not had the experience that we had. it i incumbent on a govern who said that they would want to look at the evidence and make decisions on the basis of hard fact to list to the evidence bee given by people who have been through this process and who understand the complexity of devolution in a situate where we still have a uk govern. we have had experience of this, a have the elect body, which have given their view very clear to the uk govern but have been ignore. they were not consult before this, but they gave their view and told of their experience, so it i not ask too much of any govern to say, "" perhaps we have not got this right. "" perhaps the simple the for the govern to do i not to try to see whether they could slip the election by a month, a ha been suggest by some people. that would represent the worst of all possible world for the voter, let alone for the political party. the simple the would be to say, "" we have got this wrong, but we believe in fix - term parliament. "" the labour party pose fix - term parliament in it manifesto and the liberal believe in them too. i am not sure whether the conservative believe in them, but they introduce this legislate so presumably they now do. we all seem to agree that there should be fix - term parliament. on that basis, why are we have this bate? because the coalition govern are so determine to stick to their first thought, which was to have f year. the govern may be do that on for advantage and to feel that they have the long possible time in which to be the govern. i have to say to the hon member for epping forest that she and other on the govern bench may feel that they have an entitle to sit for f year, have been elect, but a lot of people in the country have a very different view. the majority party in the coalition did not get a majority for it policy. the junior partner in the coalition went to the people on a different set of policy, so the people who vote for the liberal did not vote for the programme of this coalition govern. the government approach seem particular fortunate for democracy in this country, given that the govern do not have a mandate to rule in the majoritarian fashion that they are do. come from scotland and have seen both coalition and minority government in operate, i am very open to various way of running a govern. i would not for a minute want to suggest that it always ha to be an absolute majority, that first past the post i what we need or that we need majorities. i thank my hon friend for hi intervention, with which i wholly agree. ordinary elector thought that a hung parliament would be a good idea, because they genuine believe that there would be open and that people would list to different point of view. that ha not happen. the strong view of the elect government of wale, scotland and northern ireland have not been listen to. the bulk of the evidence given to the select committee on political and constitutional form, of which i am a member, was clear in favour of four - year fix - term parliament. why should that weight of evidence be ignore? was that what people expect from a more consensual and open approach? i think that a lot of people thought that coalition meant that we would get the b bit from everyone and that everyone would sit around and have discussion - the hon lady seem to think that they did get the b bit from everyone, but that make it clear to me that she did not believe in the manifesto on which she stood because so many part of it seem to have been ditch in favour of the policy of the other party. a small and simple change - a very small cession - that would not in any way interfere with the principle of fix - term parliament would make it far easy for the bill to be passe relative quick. it would allow national election in all part of the unite kingdom to go forward in the b possible way and our devolve parliament and assemblies to present their policy to the electorate in the way they want to. our media are very england - centric - and, indeed, london - centric - although govern member might not be so acute aware of that a opposite member are, and i fear that the dominate of the uk - wide poll and the important issue it involve, which must be dealt with, will be such that the important election for the scottish parliament, the welsh assembly and the northern ireland assembly will, sad, be overwhelm. i fear that the issue, idea and important policy that concern those election will not be fully bate before the population, that the argument will not be proper heard and that people will not get the chance to have their say about how those legislature have function in the precede year, but it i important that they should get that say. the bulk of the evidence that the select committee heard was that what i bee ask i not a lot. it seem to be simply stubbornness - perhaps it i about political advantage above all else - to stick to the same position in the face of all the argument that we have heard. i hope that it i not too late, even now, for the govern to rethink their position and to allow the bill to pass through the house with the agree of all party because we have reach genuine consensus.",1,0.137,0.24,0

clear, in decide the identity and approve the judge, one set of criteria would be important - namely, that the appoint i suit - but whether the suspense should occur i a slight wide question. doe my hon and learn friend think hi proposal would affect the material on which the decision would be made? doe the hon gentleman think that there will be a full lock in the sense that the lord chief justice could continue to fuse to accept the appoint of any judge - in effect, fuse one aft another - thus deal with the point made by my hon and learn friend the member for beaconsfield? the secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor ha made a strong case for hi view that the lord amend already goes far enough, but i am sorry to tell him that i still have doubt about that. the crucial the about a coroner i that he i an dependent judge who investigate and decide who a person was, whether they die, and if they did, why they die, or what they die of. that role goes back in our history to a time when this country was very trouble, and important people felt that they might be able to take the law to their own hand. it ha been an important protection for our people, go back century. it i clear from schedule 1 that we suspend coroners' investigate on in rare and important circumstance. if somebody i charge with murder, the coroner investigate will be suspend so that there can be a fair criminal trial. there are also other limit circumstance in which that would happen. it ha been a principle for a very long time that one doe not suspend a coroner investigate except in very important circumstance. we are face threat of terrorism, which can lead to deaths, and a war in afghanistan, which can lead to deaths, and sometime the circumstance of those deaths may be of embarrass to the govern and to the power that be. from the very beginning, therefore, the worry with the bill ha been that in those circumstance, there might be a sire for a secret process that i not a open a a coroner quest. it i therefore good that we have been able to bate the issue over a period to try to reach the point where a coroner investigate cannot be stopped by ministerial fiat. that concern ha boil down to the situate before u, where it i accept that there might be an inquiry - rather than an quest - and, therefore, a suspense, whereby the investigate might need to be taken in private. the on example that i can think of i when something like intercept evidence i involve, and i think that the hon member for hendon take the same view. that bring u to the amendment. the lock, which the lord chancellor ha pose, i that it would be for the lord chancellor to decide whether to suspend the quest and have an inquiry; a senior judge would then be appoint a chairman of the inquiry; but the lord chief justice would be able to indicate that he did not want to approve the appoint of that judge. a the justice secretary and lord chancellor ha said, that could mean any judge, but the solute that my hon and learn friend the member for beaconsfield suggest in amend i a far less cumbersome mechanism. pose new paragraph 1 of schedule 1 would make it clear from the outset that the lord chief justice had to g approval not just to the appoint of that judge, but to the suspense of the quest. that i a different question. the lord chancellor and i may have to agree on that point, but i believe that the decision about whether to suspend the quest i different from the decision about whether to appoint a judge. the lord chancellor might take the view that the suspense i proper and the lord chief justice might not agree, but he might none the less agree to the appoint of the judge if he feel that that i a broad accept decision. i do not agree with that, but what i the material on which the lord chief justice will make hi decision, and what will be the ground for it? if he ha to decide whether to appoint a judge to an inquiry, hi view about the criteria, the material that he want to see and so on may be different from hi view if he ha to second - guess and decide whether to suspend an quest. they are not the same question. the lord chancellor assure me that they are the same question and all the same the, but it doe not say that anywhere. the criteria for the lord chief justice to make hi decision about the appoint of the judge are not set down anywhere, but the extra lock, which my hon and learn friend pose, make the matte absolute clear. amend say that the lord chief justice would have to approve not on the appoint of the judge, but the investigation suspense. they are different question, but that amend would cover them complete and mean that, in future, an satisfactory decision could not be made.",1,0.142,0.097,0

of - control youths with air weapon. no week passe without some new horror story. last week, for example, a you in cardiff shot and injure four children in a school playground. it i credible that no licence i require for an air weapon and that anyone over 14 can own one. it i necessary urgent to reduce the numb of air weapon in circulation, and the crime bill i an obvious opportunity to do that. once again, the home secretary will find that there i a helpful select committee port on the stock. i urge him to dust it down. drug lie behind a great deal of crime and the ruin of many young live. my right hon friend the member for holborn and st. pancras graphical illustrate the problem. enormous effort have gone to combat the drug culture and i do not seek to denigrate them. i wonder, however, whether we are have a serious impact. perhaps the time ha come to consider a new approach. the home secretary will have seen a recent series of article in the guardian by mr. nick davies. i know that he i not my right hon friend's favourite journalist, but i hope he will agree that mr. davies ha made some serious point that quire equal serious examination. legalisation i traditional a subject on which politician fear to tread. let me hast to add that i am not yet persuade, but given that everything else ha fail, i wonder whether the time ha come to contemplate the thinkable. that may well be something on which the select committee can be helpful. i hope that select committee will be function by the summer and i would welcome an assurance on that from my right hon friend the lead of the house. i hope also that he i consider way in which select committee can be made more effect. he will have seen the recent port by the hansard society and the port by the liaison committee, "" shift the balance "", which incidental was brush aside a little too hastily. i hope that my right hon friend, who ha a reputation for radical think, will take them serious. i also hope that hon member will take select committee serious. we cannot expect minister to do that if we do not. the first rule for an effect select committee member i to turn up on time; the second i to keep one backside on the seat throughout the sitting; the third i to ask concise, relevant question, for which short train course can be arrange if necessary. aft that, we can have a discussion about power and source. for what it i worth, it i my view that the on hope of make select committee function effective i to create an alternate career structure for back - bench member; otherwise we are for ever destine to see the b and the bright seduce away by office or the prospect of office. if we sometime wonder why the house and our profession in general do not enjoy the public esteem that we believe we serve, at least part of the solute lie in our own hand. we do not have to award the govern a three -

it i base on the hmic's view of the save that can be made without damage front - line service. i am please to have the opportunity to speak in this bate. no labour member would argue with the contention that there i always scope for efficiency in public service, include the police service. my right hon friend the member for normanton, pontefract and castleford spoke about the hmic port, a did the minister. our opposite to what the govern are planning i base on the sheer scale of the cut to the police service that are set out. my additional argument, on which i will elaborate and on which i intervene on the minister, i that there i unfair in the allocate of those cut a between different police force around the country. i should like to com on the work that merseyside police are do. a in the case, i imagine, of most, if not all hon member on both side of the house, crime and antisocial behaviour are consistent the biggest issue that my constituent raise with me on the doorstep, in survey, in correspondence and at surgery. in recent year, merseyside police have face some very serious challenge. merseyside i no. 1 of any police force in the country in term of the numb of drug offences. i am therefore very concern about the impact of cut that are bee made to the uk border agency, a well a cut to local govern and voluntary sector service for those with drug addiction. in other area, merseyside ha made truly remark progress in recent year. in 2005 - 06, it was the third high police force in the country for violent crime, with a rate of 25.6 offences p 1,000 population. thank to the hard work of the police, include their work with the local community, that rate ha halve over the past f year to 13 p 1,000, putt u 22nd in england, which put it in the low half of police force. that i truly remark progress. every indicate that i have i that merseyside police are determine to continue that progress, even in the text of the cut that we are cuss. almost four year ago in what i now my constituency, there was the tragic murder of rhys jones. hi death provide the text for a great focus on crime, include violent crime, in liverpool and across merseyside. in consider the way forward for merseyside and the fair, or rather unfair, of the pose cut, everyone in my constituency i concern to ensure that never again do we see the tragedy of what happen to young rhys. the police respond brilliant and with great professionalism in that case, which result in serious conviction by the court for those who murder rhys jones. already in 2010 - 11, 200 police office job and 80 police staff job are bee lost in merseyside. there i a moratorium on further recruit, which will continue to next year. the police have estimate that by march 2012 - in just over a year time - we will have lost almost 10 % of police office post in merseyside. the hon member for carshalton and wallington talk about chief constable make every effort to ensure that lose police office post i a last sort. i think i wrote down correct that he said that some chief constable were treat it a their first sort. i very much doubt that that i the case in any authority. i can say with certainty that it i not the case in merseyside, where the chief constable, whom i and other liverpool mps met in the house a couple of week ago, ha made every effort to maximise efficiency and minimise the direct impact on local people through the loss of police office. absolute; i concur with my hon friend. of course, that i not the on promise that the liberal democrat made to the british people last may that they have broken. they made that promise knowing, a my hon friend said, what the budget position was. it was a deep irresponsible pledge to make. the figure were very much in the public domain. to be fair to the conservative party, it did say that it would prioritise cut. there i a specific issue about the liberal democrat have said one the in opposite and say the complete opposite now that they are part of the coalition govern. my hon friend make hi point powerful. i will not focus the re of my speech on liberal democrat broken promise, but the case ha been very well made. i intervene on the minister to raise the question of the fair of the distribute of the cut. he set out the consultation process in some tail, and entire understandably set out the force and authority that would lose out if there were some attempt to protect those that were more reliant on central govern fund and they had lobby against that. i appreciate what he said about the nature of the formula and the difficulty of change it, and clear the cut relate to the original formula. fortunate, i am not suggest that that can be change quick, but i repeat what i said in my intervention: i hope that the govern will consider the matte a we move forward. look at the estimate police budget figure that the library ha produce, we see that in the forthcoming financial year, 2011 - 12, merseyside's estimate police budget, taking to account local venue raise a well a central govern fund, will be cut by 5. 8 % whereas surrey cut will be 3.7 %. there i every indicate that that gap will apply again in the follow year and therefore have a cumulative effect. in merseyside, there have consistent been crease in the police authority precept over recent year. the local police authority ha not thought, "" we're getting all this money from central govern, so we can let our council tax payer off and freeze the precept or have on a mod crease. "" there have been significant crease in the amount contribute by council tax payer in merseyside to the fund of the police. the basic reality i that on average, people in merseyside are poor than people in surrey. the reason why merseyside's local police pend more on central govern fund than other i primarily to do with privation. that point apply also to other authority, and when there are cut on the scale that we are seeing, it i a cause for great concern. to hi credit, the minister undertook early to consider the matte again in future. perhaps i might ask that he meet merseyside mps at hi ear convenience to cuss those concerns. the minister nod, so i am light to accept that we can have that meet. clear, the cut will have an impact on force right across the country, but that impact will diff. when there are spend cut on such a scale, it i incumbent on the govern to consider the unfair of those different impact. there i clear a need for save in public expenditure on the police, and hmic ha consider the matte in great tail and come up with the quote figure of 12 %. my contention today i, first, that by go so significant above that figure, the govern will inevitably damage the police service across the country; second, that the effect are not fair or consistent but diff for the reason that i have given; and third, that those effect are compound by the impact of other cut in public spend, particular local govern cut. merseyside police receive direct fund from liverpool and other local authority for aspect of it work on antisocial behaviour. i hope that the council will be able to protect that fund, but i am not confident that they will be fully able to do so. on top of the cut that we are cuss today, liverpool's police force and other around the country will therefore lose further fund for some of the important partnership work that they do on tackle antisocial behaviour. i urge the govern to think again, and i urge home office minister to press the treasury to g police and law and order the priority that the govern have given school and the national heal service. voter - our constituent - would expect u to g the police service that priority, and i hope that in the light of today bate, the govern will do so.",0,0.036,0.102,0.99

at least not with liberal democrat member - the vision passe in the other place to peal seditious libel and criminal libel i one that once again we cannot bate. i hope the house will therefore accept that i have a cord of support free speech. i want to make it very clear that i support free speech for homophobes. i believe that people who are homophobic - that will include some religious people who may not necessarily tend any offence, but they are perceive a homophobic by some people - should have the right to free speech without great restriction, albeit within certain limit. it i a good the that we are cuss homosexuality in the text of free speech rather than the right and wrong of homosexuality. i think that that i a sign of how the have progress during my time in the house. i have to say to support of the waddington amend, however, that they are promote the wrong amend. if they want to tackle the exist mischief and the future mischief of over - police of comment that might be taken to be homophobic, they have to ensure that our law doe not criminalise insult speech, whether intentional or not, that i short of threaten - or, in the case of directly cause harass, tress and alarm to someone, something that i short of abuse. while "" insult "" exist in the public order act, insert this vision to it will, with or without the waddington amend, still make people feel that they cannot insult people on the basis of sexual orientate and will still make the police believe - perhaps the police should think much more careful about this, but the "" insult "" vision i on the statute book - that they have to investigate complaint, particular given the fact that people feel that the police should take serious complaint about incitement to hatred or insult behaviour on the ground of race, sexual orientate or religion. i thus urge the house to recognise that in a sense we are bate the wrong amend. i will come on in a few moment to the right amend to move the insult vision from the statute book, but it ha been put to this house - although not bate - and i support by the joint committee on human right. it would be much less, because the police clear would not investigate in the outrageous case about which we have heard. the treatment of pauline howe, whom the hon gentleman mention early, was not proportionate but absurd. it was graceful that the police waste their time on such a matte. if the "" insult "" vision was not there, i am certain that the problem would be less. we cannot legislate for every over - officious police office, but we can make a clear statutory change to get rid of that vision. although we are not bate that vision now, it i relevant. i am an eternal optimist, and i believe that we should aim for the right legislate, not create the wrong legislate on the way to getting the right legislate. my hon friend and i will support the govern in the lobby tonight, and i suspect that there will be another large majority in favour of delete the vision, so the matte will go back to the house of lord. however, their lordship should apply themselves to the specific legislate where the problem lie. let me set out the reason for the position taken by the liberal democrat. a the minister said, the incitement to racial hatred vision current ha a low threshold. however, the religious hatred vision right ha a much high threshold - it was important that that was restrict to threaten language, and that "" intentional "" was a requisite part of the offence. given the importance of bee able to proselytise free, or to criticise religion, there should be a broad free speech save that was not about religious duct or practice but about the arena in which speech would take place, such a those of political course, comedy, performance or broadcast. clear, that would not be in the nature of language that was threaten and tend to cite hatred such a when talk to a bunch of skinhead in a pub. the measure that we agree for religious hatred i therefore the right one. in relate to hatred on the ground of sexual orientate, the govern have done what i essential: they have ensure that the measure deal with threaten on, and intentional language on. i can think of no pastor or street preach who i so extreme that they would seek to cite hatred and use threaten language. they might do one or the other, but it i hard to imagine a preach who would do both. i do not necessarily have good view of religious extremist, but i cannot think of one who i likely to do that. some religious extremist cite violence directly, and that i already an offence, but they do not go the roundabout way of tend to stir up hatred use threaten language; they usual talk about measure that cite violence directly. no example ha been given of the sort of religious speech that would be cover, without the so - call save. the save i unnecessary to protect religious speech. however, there i a real dang out there of extremist political party use threaten language about sexual orientate that i tend to stir up hatred, without otherwise breach another part of the statute. again, let u imagine the british national party say something homophobic in the text of paedophilia, which i, of course, a myth about homosexuality. however, if it i cite, and if it use the word, "" and they've got it come to them, "" that add the threat, and that i the real mischief. we know how child abuse i sometime dealt with in the popular press, and how that can create the sort of mob mentality that i the execute of the incitement of hatred. that would right be caught by the offence. this offence ha not exist for long while the free speech save clause ha been in place, so i do not think that there ha been an issue in that regard. what we must deal with i the exist mischief, rather than hypothetical situate. there i a real threat of incitement to homophobic hatred by extremist political party, a oppose to the religious. the example that i gave would not current constitute an offence because it doe not directly cite violence, but cite hatred and involve the use of threaten language. until we have this law, there was no vision to deal with incitement to hatred on ground of sexual orientate. let me turn to the so - call waddington amend. i do not doubt the sincerity of member who support it, but i note that it sponsor in the lord were not very keen on free speech when it came to the peal of the blasphemy law, and general have not been fend of free speech when it come to terrorism law. there i clear a lobby in favour of extra vision for free speech in one area, the area of sexual orientate, but we must take that on it merit. what concerns me about that amend i that it word create fusion. let me g the hon and learn member for beaconsfield an example, because he invite me to do so. the amend state that the "" criticism of sexual... practice or the urge of person to refrain from or modify such duct or practice shall not be taken of itself to be threaten or tend to stir up hatred. "" doe that mean that if some extremist group, probably political rather than religious, say, "" these gay should keep their dirty practice away from our children or they will get what i come to them, "" that would be cover by the clause? they might think, right or wrong, that because they were restrict their language to criticism of practice - and it i clear critical of a sexual practice - and urge people to refrain from such practice, albeit in an outrageous and distort way, they would benefit from the protection of the clause. they might say that their language should not of itself be taken to be threaten or tend to stir up hatred, although it clear i threaten and doe stir up hatred. i think it i a bit too late for the hon and learn gentleman to get out hi law book aft the damage ha been done, and to say, "" no, actual they do not benefit from the save clause "", but i should be grateful if he could address the issue. what if i say to the hon and learn gentleman that the word was, "" these gay had better keep their dirty practice away from our children ""? there i a threat in that word, but i the hon and learn gentleman say that that of itself should not be taken to be threaten or tend to stir up hatred? this i the difficulty, and i note that the hon and learn gentleman i not rise to deal with it. there i not a direct threat in the word "" had better "", but there i an implicit threat. i could also have use the word "" or else "". in the text of a mob or crowd of skinhead, for example, in a pub back room, that i a problem. that i the opine of the hon and learn gentleman, but it i not apparent in the word of the save clause. it could be taken to lead people to believe that a long a they talk on about sexual duct or practice and not about homosexuality itself, nor about people themselves, that was a get - out. it i no good say, "" well, when the first case i prosecute, this will filter out to the mob, "" because that i not the way these the work. i therefore think this i unnecessary and, a the minister said, it could cause fusion. i agree about whether it would be cover, but we do not have to agree on that; rather, we have to recognise that it i not clear law. what matte i whether the mob stirred up think it i, because that i what cause the damage. it i not for the court to decide whether it i a reason state. the court ha to decide whether it stir up hatred, whether it was tend to stir up hatred and whether the language was threaten; and aft the damage ha been done it i too late for member to come back and say, "" well, the save clause wasn't real tend to cover this, and on a narrow argument. "" it look a though it doe g a let - out; and it i not an offence to accuse other person named of criminal offences - we do that all the time - so there i no alternate prosecute. i do not accept that that i clear, but i also feel strong that whether or not that i the case, it i not apparent to people read the statute what the save clause doe and doe not allow; that i simply not clear. to put the word "" for the avoidance of doubt "" in front of the vision doe not make it any clear. in fact, it make it seem that it should be obvious, and when it i not obvious, one i puzzle. final, i want to move on to the alternate way of deal with this. there have been occasion - include all the example that have been given, such a the lancashire and norfolk case, iqbal sacranie and lynette burrows - when the people concern have been question by the police. that must stop. the joint committee on human right ha made it very clear in it considerations of this matte that it i time for the "" insult "" vision to be move from the public order act. it said that in the police and test inquiry, which was in the seven port of 2007 - 08, and it said it in it eighth port, on this bill. it i welcome that the govern are look at this. however, i hope the minister will be able to say in wind up that they have stopped look and are now go to start do, because i do not think there i opposite to this anywhere in the house. the police may object, because they want the ability to start question anyone who insult anyone else short of bee threaten or abuse, but that i not good enough. if the govern are serious about protect free speech, they have to deal with this, because there ha been a prosecute. the case of hammond v. dpp involve "" an elder street preach who preach in the centre of bournemouth on a saturday afternoon while hold a large sign with the word: ' stop immorality', 'stop homosexuality', 'stop lesbianism ' and ' jesus i lord'. a hostile crowd of some 30 to 40 people had form, some of whom act violent by assault mr. hammond. aft hi refusal to desist from preach, and follow substantial bate among themselves... the police decide to arrest hammond rather than hi opponent and he was duly convict of play an 'insulting ' sign cause 'alarm or distress'... contrary to section 5 of the public order act 1986.

operate, they gain understand and become less worry and their confidence in the process grow. i agree that the information that the commission feel able to make avail and that it i encourage to produce i worth while, especial a provisional ira commission i important when it come to the worry and fear of the unionist community. it i not that that role was given over entire, but there was agree that it would be part of the mechanism of the procedure. people had many idea about what they were sign up to, and that i what i important. we are try to hold people together. i accept that the hon gentleman i, and always ha been, implacably oppose to the agree, and that it i legitimate for him to use anything that affect northern ireland which i brought before the house to advance hi case. however, some of u stand on different, and not easy, ground. we try to draw different people together in difficult circumstance. the logic of the argument of the hon gentleman and people who think like him i not given great considerate by u. let me say something in favour of the word "" credible "" and "" significant "" a use by de chastelain. one set of people that they upset considerably, and who it i worth while upsetting, are member of the provisional ira and sinn fein. the more they think that there ha been a reason and important hand over or destruction of weaponry, the more that affect their traditional feel and attitude, and the more they are enchant by the process and by those who are involve in the political process. if it were spell out that mass commission was taking place, they would be even more enchant. the act of commission might not be a significant a some of u would wish, but it i a reason avenue to pursue. the perception of people within the provisional ira and sinn fein are important in how we advance the process. i was not argue that. i was say that the hon member for spelthorne and for belfast, east and some other hon member want to go beyond what i contain in the new clause. that reflect their initial agree and current enchant with the belfast agree and the development since it was reach, although it i not the position of those on the conservative front bench. that i why i describe the new clause a a halfway house. it try to get better information and great clarity to the process and to put a bit of pressure on the commission, but it doe not deliver what some opposite member hop it would. i am not say that what the new clause attempt to achieve i consistent. however, it i legitimate for those of u who support the belfast agree now to bate the reason way forward in the circumstance. how commission i interpret by certain publican force and people within northern ireland i an important considerate. the hon member for belfast, east made an interesting point about the distinction between the word "" significant "" and "" credible "". he engage in a good piece of language analysis. he show that "" significant "" could be use to scribe a significant move to which the commission might respond. however, there i another use of "" significant "". was the commission itself significant and credible? de chastelain tell u in the port that the amount of commission was significant; he doe not say that it was mere a significant act. perhaps the general felt that the move was significant, which it was, and that even if a small amount was involve, it was also significant.",0,0.183,0.509,0.999

"" i conclude that that was, in part, a tribute to our free press, who, a we know, have been preoccupy with other matte. on each of the occasion when our prime minister ha gone to washington in the last year, the press have decide from the outset - before he ha left british soil - that hi trip will be a aster. on the first of hi two trip, they pursue him with a single question: "" prime minister, will you apologise for the cession? "" they kept that up. i believe that mr. nick robinson even took it to the oval office of the white house. the americans were amaze. during the second trip, which took place on a few week ago, the headline was "" obama snub brown "". a member may call, the president and the prime minister were go to new york to attend a unite nation meet. there was not to be a face - to - face meet between them there; but the next day they were off to the g20 summit in philadelphia, where there was plenty of face time, and the story swift fad. nevertheless, it had dominate the headline, even in the broadsheet newspaper. if member wonder why we in this country know nothing about the british government intervention in the bank crisis, it may have something to do with those distractions. a so often, the hon gentleman doe not get it right. i am not argue that. i am just say that the british govern did quite a lot in bring this most recent - and particular large - crisis to a halt, not just in this country, but around the world. many distinguish foreign appear to have notice that, even if the hon gentleman and we in this country have not. i was please to hear the liberal democrat spokesman, the hon member for twickenham, acknowledge that today, a he ha done on several previous occasion. that i why he i taken more serious than the hon member for tatton, who speak for the official opposite on these matte. let me mention something else i thought while watch that programme. i also thought it at the institute of director dinner last night, at which i had a ringside seat. iod director general mile templeman was demand less govern interference, of course, and a he was play on home ground that was great welcome by hi audience. in fact, he was ask for many of the same the that the hon member for north - w norfolk was just request: less govern interference, less re tape, less this and less that, and small govern. i thought to myself, "" good, it lucky there was some govern interference around last autumn, when the bank went belly - up. i didn't hear any talk about the need for small govern then, when the world economy face potential ruin. "" over the year, all the main political party have indulge to some extent in the pretence that we in this country can have a european level of public service while pay on american level of taxation. we are all guilty of have encourage that belief. a a result, when there i an argument about cut versus tax crease, it i assume across the board that on cut will do. indeed, there was a period a few months ago when the lead of all three main party appear to be vying with each other on cut. the lead of the liberal democrat was, i was shock to hear, call for bold and savage cut at hi conference, which cannot have gone down too well with hi punt. the lead of the liberal democrat i a wide boy and a chancer a far a i am concern, and if he think that i go to get hi party any vote, he i wrong. if people want bold and savage cut, they will vote for the conservative, not the liberal democrat. i think that we do need to contemplate the possibility that, soon or late, the basic rate of come tax will have to rise - i am not talk about tax the rich, because that i often a cop - out a it doe not raise the necessary sum. the basic rate of come tax ha come down consistent over the year. it was 25p in the pound a recent a 1995, but success chancellor have reduce it so it now stand at 20p. soon or late, a political party in this country will have to front the electorate with the reality that if we want european level of public service, we will have to pay european level of taxation. that cannot just be paid for by the rich; the prosperous - or the relative prosperous - will have to tribute a well. there may well need to be a rise in the basic rate of come tax, therefore. final, i want to say a few word about "" broken britain "". we have heard quite a lot on that subject from those on the conservative bench. those of u who represent less prosperous area of the country know a the or two about broken britain. when i was first elect to parliament in 1987, at every single surgery that i held people from the poor part of my constituency came to me begging to be evacuate from various notorious estate. all that ha stopped over the last f to 10 year. there were part of my constituency where normal life had broken down to such an extent that we had to evacuate the few remain resident and demolish entire street - indeed, in one case, a large part of an entire estate. i fear that there i a dang that we might turn to that situate. that i broken britain. sandhill view school in my constituency i a secondary school. twelve year ago it was achieve a gcse result rate on the f a to c grade measure of less than 10 p cent. today, that rate i more than 50 p cent. the school ha been complete built, it i under complete new manage and more than 50 p cent. of the pupil are getting those result, despite the catch area bee the same. so when somebody tell me that nothing ha change and everything i bad and getting worse, i can put my hand on my heart and honest say that the poor people in my constituency - i would be surprise if this were fine on to my constituency - are significant better off a a result of this govern. i dread that in future we may go back to where we were in the late '80s, when there was mass employment, and a breakdown in the social fabric and in law and order. some future govern would then have to clear up the mess, a this govern are still do to some extent. i hope that we will not go down that pa again. i am told that a new, merciful and compassionate conservative party ha arisen from the ash of the greedy and mean conservative party - i accept that there have been some change at the top, but i do not believe that down below that i the case. i think that the party ha the same philosophy and want one the on: tax cut for the already prosperous.",0,0.051,0.027,0.996

the numb of people who vote - or the turnout of those who express a preference. in other word, should it leave out or include those who spoil their ballot paper? alternative, should it relate to those who vote ye to change. obvious, in country that have written constitutions all this tend to be laid down; it i one of the key element that i written down. if someone want to change any element of the constitute in germany, spain or many other country, they have to obtain a fix percentage - normal great than an absolute majority - to be able to effect change. in the german constitute, any change ha to be given a successful mandate aft two subsequent general election. i do not believe that that i the way we have tend to do the in the british system. the scar of history can g u principle - that i the truth of it. that may well apply to the conservative party too in relate to some of the the it ha had to change in recent year. i point out that if there were to be a threshold for election to this house or to council seat, especial in council by - election, there would undoubted be some occasion when people would not be turn, because voter might choose to do precise what happen, a my hon friend the member for liverpool, w derby ha said, in some country where there i a threshold. rose - in some country that have threshold, people are persuade to boycott. if people felt that they did not like any of the candidate, they might decide that the b way not to turn a candidate was to boycott the election. i am not so sure actual. my hon friend i absolute right that there i no fix determine policy that we are complete and utter in all case implacably oppose to threshold. nor, for that matte, i there a belief that we ardent should have threshold. however, i suspect that the hon member for stone ha table this amend in some sense a a wreck amend, in that he doe not real want av, and that i part of hi intention. i accept that that might not be hi intention, but none the less it might be the result of such a the. i was actual try not to suggest a threshold. the hon lady i right in one sense, of course. i hope that this might appease my hon friend the member for blackley and broughton a regard some of what he said. there i a complexity about the referendum that we might have next may, because we might have very differential turnout in wale, scotland, northern ireland and england. if, for stance, there were to be a very low turnout in england that turn a no vote and a very high turnout in the other place - there i a scottish parliamentary election, in northern ireland there are two other set of election and in wale there i the assembly election at the same time, and in wale and scotland those feel in many sense like general election - turn significant ye vote, people might start to question the validity of what we were do. this i all the more important because the referendum i not just an advisory referendum - a referendum have always been in the past - but an implement referendum. in other word, if there i a ye vote, it come to law. it happen, and the next general election will be held on the basis of the alternate vote. i am not convince by the argument that are bee advance in favour of threshold. i personal will be vote ye in the referendum. i do not believe that there should be a referendum, but there i a legitimate argument that other might want to consider about whether the fact that we are combine the poll will produce a differential turnout in different part of the country that might make a necessity of a threshold. i think that a welsh colleague i desirous of my attention. absolute. a somebody who support alternate vote, which i know my hon friend doe not, and a somebody who will want to see a ye vote in the referendum, i find that one of the most press the - i think this i true of other in the chamber who want to see change to the electoral system - i that the way in which the govern and, in particular, the deputy prime minister have proceed with this ha made it more difficult for many to advocate that cause and to push for form. now, i shall g way to the hon member for epping forest - she no longer want me. a the hon member for stone said early, two different threshold are pose. one i that there will be a 25 % ye threshold - that i, that we would have to secure 25 % of the electorate to count for a ye, and that can be found in amend 197. the other i the turnout referendum of 40 % that the hon gentleman ha already pose. i think that it would be inappropriate to move forward with either of the two threshold and i urge hon member to vote against them. the difficulty about threshold in the labour movement i that, for stance, i suppose one could have said that there should be a threshold for the election of candidate for the labour party - or, for that matte, for the lead of the labour party. i think that that would be inappropriate. when we have an election, we in the labour movement have always proceed on the basis of alternate vote - to be fair, in the past, for a brief period, we use a single vote but then there was a run - off that was use for several year. for several year now - for several decade, in fact - we have use the alternate vote to select candidate when there i a single member stand. when there are multiple member, we use first past the post. the point that i want to make i that i do not think that it i appropriate to bring in a threshold at this time, but i fully understand that there are other who say that because of the way in which the govern are push forward with this legislate and because it i an implement referendum, a threshold would be appropriate. to be hon, i would prefer u to have a written constitute in which all those element were laid out, but that i not what i before u tonight. one could go around this chamber and see on what portion of the vote of the total electorate any one of u was elect - aft all, the position in amend 197 i that one would have to be elect by a portion of the electorate. i think that that would be inappropriate. we have a system in this country where someone either win or lose the vote. there would be a strong point in argue that this should not be an implement referendum, but mere an advisory referendum. the house would therefore be able to take a decision on the basis of what turnout there had or had not been. i would hate to see the campaign simply to boycott the referendum that would almost certain arise from those who are oppose to a change. rose - my hon friend made that point in a previous discussion, and he i absolute right. we should have a straightforward system where people fight to win their side of the argument. they win that side of the argument by getting people past the ballot box to vote either ye or no. that i why i am, broad speak, oppose to referendum. let me issue one tiny note of caution, which come from the problem that the govern are give u by combine the poll on 5 may. a the hon member for epping forest said early, this ha absolute nothing to do with whether people are bright enough or stupid enough to understand two different position that might be put to them - the voter are perfect intelligent enough to be able to do that - but we will have different turnout in different part of the country, which will cause a significant problem. when my hon friend the member for cardiff w said early that a no vote in the referendum would be a significant problem for the deputy prime minister, the deputy lead of the house said from a sedentary position, "" no, it wouldn't real. "" so the cat i out of the bag: the deputy prime minister could not care less whether the referendum i successful - whether it lead to a ye or no vote. i think, a do many member on both side of the house who would real like a form of the electoral system, that that betray the cause that many people had thought essential to the liberal party. that i why many of u have a profound suspicion that the deputy prime minister i in this less for sound principle than for self - advance.",0,0.165,0.309,0.998

719,"it i a great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for croydon central, whose mark have been very support. the amend table by my hon friend the member for christchurch i very interesting, but i fear that it doe not do what he seem to think it doe. a he i an experience member, i say with some trepidation that hi amend i defect. he seem to be explain that, in effect, it deliver a supplementary vote system under which on the top two candidate are cap of winning the election and all the other candidate are eliminate, and therefore voter on express two preference. that i not what hi amend doe, however. it limit the numb of preference to be express to two, but that doe not have the effect he was hop for. under hi amend, it would still be possible for a candidate who had come third and been eliminate to win the election if they were the recipient of many second preference. i therefore fear that hi amend i technical defect, because it doe not do what he clear outline he wish it to do. given that, i ask my hon friend to withdraw it. in choose the form of av that i pose in the bill, we were very clear that we want the optional preferential system a we did not want voter to be force to vote for candidate they could not stomach. we thought it was not right to force voter to have to express a preference for a british national party candidate, for stance, when they think that the view that that candidate espouse are repugnant. however, we also thought that voter should be free to vote for just one candidate if they so wish. there should be maximum choice for the elector. that i why we chose the system that i in the bill a the one to put to the elector, and i commend it to the committee. i will try not to stray too far outside the term of this bate, and i will not get to a bate from the patch box on the merit of different electoral system. the govern are pose this referendum with the choice between first past the post and av, and the govern are neutral on those two electoral system. that i a matte for the ye and no campaign, and for the member campaign in them. the govern will not express a preference from the patch box. i will, however, take my hon friend through both hi argument and the reason why we support putt to the voter the system pose in the bill. if i have right understood my hon friend's argument - i am sure he will correct me if i am wrong - he was putt forward the supplementary vote system use in london. that ha two feature. first, voter have on two choice: they can express on two preference, which i also what hi amend pose. second, if no candidate get over 50 % of first preference vote - i think i am right in say that no candidate ha done so since the system was put in place - on the top two candidate stay in the race. all other candidate are eliminate, and the second preference of those who vote for those eliminate candidate are distribute, and we then cover which of the top two win. that i the piece that my hon friend's amend doe not insert to the bill, however. my hon friend's amend could lead to a situate that i think he said he would find undesirable, in that it would still be perfect possible for a candidate who had not finish in the top two to be the winner if they receive a significant numb of second preference vote from those who were first eliminate. i am grateful, m primarolo. i think my hon friend the member for christchurch want to intervene. we have put a verse of av in clause 7, so that i clear the system the govern believe the voter should have a choice on. they should choose between that system or the exist system of first past the post. we consider the london supplementary vote system, but we did not choose it because we want to g voter the maximum amount of choice. a my hon friend the member for croydon central set out, we want to g voter the opportunity to select from the range of candidate instead of just give them two choice. that i not what i said, and my hon friend will know that we are cuss the system for elect member to the house of commons. the choice of system that the coalition govern want to put before the elector in a referendum i the choice of either stick with first past the post or use the alternate vote system that we have put forward. the reason we thought it important to put in the bill the verse of the alternate vote system that will come to effect if there i a ye vote in the referendum - the bate ha brought this out - i that voter are clear about what they are vote for. it i also so that the two campaign - the ye campaign and the no campaign - can look at the bill and clear explain to voter the system that they are vote for or against, and the consequence of that system. voter can then make an form choice. it i difficult to start to get behind what i on ballot paper, and to analyse the amount of thought that voter put in to what they write on them. i am sure that all of u, when we have look at the result of election in our constituency and council election, have sometime wonder what thought process voter use in cast their vote. we have not always agree with the result, but democracy i a wonderful the; we g everyone who i over the age of 18 and who i eligible to vote the chance to do so. in a democracy, we have to take the result that we get and make the b of them, regardless of the amount of thought put to them. i will not try to psychoanalyse how voter will express their preference and how much thought they put to them. i am grateful to my hon friend for that point. i have seen the odd piece of analysis that say that even under the exist first - past - the - post system, it make a small difference which end of the ballot paper one name i on. it real come down to the point that i made to the hon member for great grimsby: i am not go to analyse how people reach their decisions. some people reach them aft careful, consider thought, and some people do not. we just have to live with the result of their decisions in a democracy. well, no. that i a common misconception. a person vote i count on once at any one time, but clear, if someone list a numb of preference, it i more likely that the vote will still be in the count late in the process. it i up to the voter how many preference they express, and the voter can take that to account when they cast their vote. my hon friend make a very good point, and that i exact why we chose the optional preferential system - so that voter could vote once if they want to, or for a many candidate a were avail. we thought that that choice was better left to the voter. i am grateful to the hon gentleman. i am conscious, mr gale, that the chair will permit a stand part bate, so i will conclude my mark on the amend table by my hon friend the member for christchurch. a i say, i fear to point out to him that it i technical defect - it doe not do what he tend it to do - so i quest that he withdraw it and allow u to bate the clause a it i; we can then see whether the house i content to let the clause stand part of the bill. rose - let me deal with the question that i have been ask. the hon member for rhondda was quite right to f to paragraph 7 of schedule 6, which explain about the eliminate of candidate. if they are equal numb at the bottom and all the preference are the same, they will be eliminate by lot. if the hon gentleman had read a little early in that schedule, he would have been able to answer hi first question, which was about voter who have made a mark. a page 146 make clear: "" a ballot paper on which the voter make any mark which... i clear tend to indicate a particular preference for a particular candidate, but... i not a numb... shall be treat in the same way a if the appropriate numb... had been mark instead. "" a long a the voter make a clear choice, even if it i a smiley face, that will count. a in many of these issue, it i about whether there i a clear mark. if the elector mark the paper in such a way that it i not possible for the turn office to work out what they tend, it clear cannot count, so it come down to whether they have express a clear preference. in the case that the hon member for rhondda set out, it would be clear what they had done, so there would be no problem. i hesitate to jump forward, mr gale, because we are go to bate schedule 6, which i link to this clause. schedule 6 clear set out what to do if the voter doe not use numerical mark. it work in the same way a current legislate, which ask the voter to make a cross but provide that if they make some other mark on the ballot paper that show a clear preference, the turn office can count it. the example that we had yesterday, which i have seen, was that if someone put a smiley face, but on one smiley face, which show a clear intention, it can be count. we cannot put in a piece of legislate every single possible scenario; that i not done in exist legislate. we have set out what we want voter to do and we have made vision for some common issue. ultimate, a with today election, the turn office ha discrete to judge whether the voter intention are clear express. if they are, the turn office can take them to account, but if they are not, he cannot. that i how exist legislate work. i am not entire certain whether the hon gentleman want to know about the information that i require to ensure that we have a good referendum campaign, so that when voter cast their vote they know what they are vote for, or whether he i ask about if there were a ye vote - so he want to know what will happen if there were a ye vote and the system were brought in. clear, if that became the electoral system in this country, the electoral commission would, in the same way that it educate people about the exist system, explain how the system work. there i vision in the legislate about which form would be use. this i a good opportunity to explain to the hon member for rhondda something that i was go to clarify late. he i concern about the order - make power in clause 7, but it i not, a he fear, a power that allow the bill to be amend. indeed, i would be uncomfortable with that; i am sure he know my view about the power of parliament versus the execute. if there were a ye vote in the referendum and the new vote system in clause 7 and schedule 6 were brought to effect, a numb of sequential change to other legislate would be require - for example, a numb of the form use in parliamentary election would need to be amend - and this order - make power would allow the minister to make those sequential change. it would not allow the minister to change the electoral system other than through what i in this clause and schedule 6 if brought in by the electorate. the hon gentleman i rather jump ahead; we have not even passe the legislate for the referendum, let alone there have been a ye vote from the voter. he will know that the right body to carry out the educate process he scribe would be the electoral commission, which doe not receive it money from the govern. it make a quest about the source that it need to the speaker committee which put a mote before the house, which then decide what source to g to the commission, so it i a matte not for the govern but for the house to decide. i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that clarify, but he will forge me if i do not want to get to what happen in scotland a few year ago. the final question that the hon member for rhondda ask was why the bill doe not f to a candidate getting 50 % plus one of the vote. the draft i design to work not just in the first round but, a he suggest, in subsequent round. a came out in the bate on the amend from my hon friend the member for christchurch, although someone who win under the alternate vote system ha to have 50 % of the vote that are still in the count, they do not necessarily have to have 50 % plus one of the vote cast in the election, because if all voter do not express a preference, someone can get elect on a small share of the original vote. it i important that i run briefly through the tail of the clause, because, a the hon member for rhondda ha point out, if there i a ye vote next year, a minister will have to lay an order before the house and the system we are bate will be the electoral system that i use in this country to elect member to the house of commons. it i therefore worth the committee spend a little time consider what the rule would be. the first the for me to do i draw the hon gentleman attention to the part of the bill that talk about the order - make power. if there were a by - election, it would not be practical for different member of the house to be elect by different electoral system. the new system would come in at the general election so that every member of the house was elect by the same electoral system. it would be invidious to do otherwise. the clause set out the key amendment to the parliamentary election rule, which are the duct rule for parliamentary election. it insert two new rule - 37a and 45a - which concern how vote are cast by voter, how vote are count and how the winning candidate i elect. further amendment are set out in schedule 6, which will be consider late. of the range of vote system, each ha it advantage and advantage. a i have said, the govern are go to put before voter either the first - past - the - post system or this verse of the alternate vote. in develop the vision in the bill, we have taken to account legislate and practice use elsewhere in the uk where preference are use, a well a the experience of vote system in other country, such a australia, where av - albeit not the same verse a we have pose - i use in election to the house of representative and in a numb of state legislate assemblies. we have develop vision that we think are b suit to the house of commons, draw on uk and international experience. a we have already set out, voter will, by virtue of our new rule 37a, rank candidate on the ballot paper in order of preference by mark 1 against their first preference, 2 against their second preference and so on. it i important for member who were not present for the bate on amend 62 to recognise that it i the optional preferential system, so voter do not have to vote for all candidate; they can vote for a many or a few a they wish. that diff from the verse use in australia for election to the house of representative, where voter are require to rank all candidate in order of preference. the australian experience i bandy about quite a lot, but it i important for member to recognise that although there are some similarity, this i a different system from that use in australia. new rule 45a set out how the vote are to be count. candidate must secure more than 50 % of the vote in the count to be elect, so if, follow the count of voters' first preference, a candidate ha secure more than 50 % of the vote in the count at that stage, he or she i declare the winner and i elect - and i am sure great relieve. if there i no winning candidate at that stage, a further stage of count would be require. paragraph of new rule 45a provide that the candidate with the few vote i eliminate from the count process and each vote original allocate to them will be allocate to a candidate remain in the count accord to the next preference express on the ballot paper. if, aft that stage, a candidate ha more vote than the remain candidate put together - so more than 50 % left in the count - he or she i elect. if there i no winner at that stage, the count process continue until someone ha more than 50 % of the vote remain in the count and i declare the winner. new rule 45b set out what information the turn office make avail about the progress of the count at the end of each count stage, except at the final count stage, at which the candidate i elect and the result i declare under rule 50. that make sure that everyone know what i go on. in answer to the hon member for rhondda, i have already set out how the order - make power work. i hope that member are clear in their mind about which form of av the govern are pose that we ask voter about. it strike me that there i a job of work to be done during the campaign, because although member are probably relate anorak when it come to understand electoral system - aft all, that i how we get here, and we all have electoral system very close to our heart - there was a fair bit of fusion this afternoon about how amend 62 would work, and how the av system will work a set out in clause 7, so whatever side of the bate we shall be on in the electoral campaign, i think we all have our work cut out. i would therefore ask that clause 7 stand part of the bill, so that we can move close to the day when it get royal assent and we can engage in that referendum campaign. to turn to my previous point, the hon gentleman should read clause 6 more close. it state: "" the minister must make an order bring to force section 7, schedule 6 and part 1 of schedule 7 if - more vote are cast in the referendum in favour of the answer ' ye ' than in favour of the answer 'no', and the draft of an order in council laid before parliament under subsection of section 3 of the parliamentary constituency act... ha been submitted to h majesty "". in other word, this system will come to force, if there i a ye vote in the referendum, once the order ha been brought in implement the new electoral boundary. if by - election were to be held, they would be for constituency with the old boundary, not with the new one, so i think i was accurate in the way i set out the position.",1,0.21,0.383,1

on effect for those special educational need school that prioritise those children. will the specialised and more tail approach to special school be consult upon on a much wide horizon than mere head teach and teach? i say "" mere "" not because i miss them - we all acknowledge their remark work - but the minister must be aware that although many parent of pupil in special school find change in those school easy to accommodate and understand, many do not for a variety of reason. it would be quite wrong to make change to special school without ensure that every parent had been proper consult in the most tail way on those change, which may affect their children. she must know that for some parent, such change are very hard to understand. i rise in the light of the mark made by the hon member for peterborough and for east antrim, both of whom were proselytising on the basis that it would be thinkable for anybody engage with a primary school not to consult automatically, at least with the parent. i realise that this i mere anecdotal, but there i a situate in my constituency where the board of governor of a grant - maintain school - or, the aspect of the school which i grant - maintain - wish to pull the school down and build a brand - new one. no one ha consult the parent, who certain do not want that to happen. i acknowledge that that example i mere anecdotal, but it underline my underlying fear about the bill: that if it doe not say that parent must be consult on such issue, we are essentially go to destroy state educate. briefly, it i hard go to advance educational standard if a pose academy cannot get up and educate because both the school and the govern are engage in a judicial view, quite apart from the expense that such a view would create. the govern argue that the bill i permissive, but my hon friend the member for gedling ha made it abundant clear that there i no evidence why primary school should apply for academy status, so i am intrigue about the permission that the govern believe primary school are deny and, therefore, want to grant them. govern member have also argue that the bill i born of a sire to raise standard, but the issue with primary school in my constituency, all of which are over - subscribed, have very high educational standard and provide a much more round educate to the children who attend them, i that there will be a serious shortfall in place. before the general election we were form that a new primary school would be built in my constituency, and i shall not go to the debacle of build school for the future, but it ha a knock - on effect on the vision of school place - certain in an inn - london borough such a mine. that proposal now seem either to have appear or to have been thrown to the deep freeze. the override issue that parent raise with me a regard primary school i that they cannot get their child to their first - choice primary school, which almost variably i that within walk distance of where their child live. they want that not on because their child i already part of the community where they then make friend who live in the same area but because, a we are increasing aware, many parent have to juggle not on work but a variety of school age among their children. on the other day, i had a constituency case involve a mother whose third child i about to start primary school. she ha to transport the other two children to different part of the borough, and it i clear out of the question for h to be ask to take a place in another primary school that i even further away. i am somewhat bemuse a to why the govern think that their approach of academising all our school will tackle the real issue that are face my constituent and their children in relate to the vision of school place. there i another, more nuance issue in my constituency. many of the primary school are faith - base, and there i constant conflict between parent who want their children to go to a faith - base school and parent who do not want their children to go to such a school. that bring me back to my central point about academising all our school - the government continue total exclusion of the opine of parent. if it were state in the bill that parent have to be consult, i could begin to understand this. i would not understand it complete, but i could see that it might off the mean genuine to examine the issue that face many of my constituent a regard primary school. my hon friend the member for gedling mention another concern to do with nursery place link to a primary school, but he did not touch on aft - school club, which are also link to primary school, certain in my constituency. there ha also been a move toward primary school act a feed for secondary school, a well a community linkage across my entire constituency, which encompass two london boroughs. a i say, i am bemuse by the idea of academising our educational system, but the central and essential issue for me i the government total failure to acknowledge the importance of consult parent on these issue. i see that the chair of the educate committee ha turn to hi place. in an early intervention, he castigate my hon friend the member for gedling for hi criticism of the bill and said that labour was revert to some deep - frozen i do not know what - he said something about the water close over new labour. i found that somewhat surprise, because before the election he was, almost individual, the creator of the all - party group on home educate. if i member right, the central and essential argument that he consistent proselytised, and i agree with him, was that the govern of the day - my govern - had markedly fail to consult parent. that was the basis of hi argument, and i am somewhat shock that it seem to have appear from hi mind. i have not been quite so hyperbolic in my choice of verb a the hon gentleman, but it seem to me that in this bill hi govern are attempt to replicate precise what he i accuse my govern of attempt to do with regard to home - educate children. put in the simple term, the govern are ignore parents' opine. that i why the argument that they have advance on primary school, and will advance with regard to secondary school, should be fierce oppose, and i am light to see that labour member are continue to do that. the minister right say that he doe not believe that there will be a one - size - fit - all approach. however, he said early that no academy would be allow to fail. how can he guarantee that? will there be a wide range of failure prevention measure? the issue i not standard but capacity. there are sufficient place, and for the majority of primary school in my constituency there i no possibility of extend their exist site. a i said before the general election, we were promise a new primary school. where ha that gone? why are the hon gentleman govern not meet that promise? i table question ask which children in my constituency would benefit from the pupil premium and which would not, and the department did not know. follow on from the hon member for banbury, let me say that it i more than anecdotal - and certain in my constituency - that all school, primary or secondary, are over - subscribed. a the hon gentleman said, parent should be allow to educate their children a they wish, but parent who want to educate their child in a faith school - church of england, roman catholic or muslim - may find that there are no place because they have been supersede not on by people who have sudden discover their faith but by those who have had the money to buy their way to a catch area. ye, we would all like parent to see their children educate a they wish, whether it be in a faith school or a non - faith school, but what my constituent overwhelming want i to see their children educate in a local school, so they do not have to travel vast distance and so that relationship can be create with in a local area. in my opine, this group of amendment bring u to the central part of the bill, which i all to do with admissions. i have already touch lightly on the difficulty experience in my constituency. a i said on second read, if the bill goes through without further amend, we will turn the country to the bad old day of the 11 - plus. many member on the opposite bench would love the restoration of the 11 - plus and are desperate to turn to grammar school and the old - fashioned secondary modern school. under the bill, they would not even be bog - standard comprehensive, and i can member what the old secondary school were like. it i intrinsically wrong to approach educate in a way that so total exclude parents' put. it i astound that hon member, who, like me, must come across such issue in their constituency surgery, cannot foresee a position in which, should the bill go through and the academisation of our school go on, there would be a determine move on the part of some parent to exclude, first, children with special educational need; second, children who could claim free school meal; and, third, children with english a a second language. i do not know whether the hon gentleman simply doe not know or whether he i deliberate blurring the issue, but exist academy were establish by my govern in area of grievous privation in an attempt to raise the educational standard of children who not on live in deprive area, but whose whole live constitute privation. that was the central and essential mote of my govern. the hon gentleman govern pose that every secondary school in the country can sudden become an academy. i iterate what i have had occasion to say before: human nature doe not change. to go back to the point that the hon member for banbury made - that every parent ha the right to educate their child a they wish - there will always be parent who want their children to be in a particular situate, which i not inclusive, but deliberate exclusive. they would wish to exclude children whom they feel, for a variety of reason - i have given on three - should not share a school with their children. the hon gentleman will be very appoint. it i not a matte of class warfare, a he scribe it. we all understand parents' vulnerability when they are present with send their child to a school, and the agony that they go through - initial, when they first let the child go out of the front door without their bee there all the time. we all understand the anxiety that parent experience if they think that the school i not up to the standard that they sire for their children. however, we must not delude ourselves. some parent are perfect prepare to sacrifice the educate of other parents' children if they think they can gain a great advantage for their own. academy open the door to that. that i why, apart from the academic downturn to which the bill will lead, the potential for social division i horrendous. an inn - london constituency such a mine i multiracial, multicultural, multi - ethnic, multi - you - name - it - we've - got - it - and it work. people communicate and get on, and there i an exchange of culture, tradition and identity and a sense of community, which i share by all. it i inherent in the bill, however, that it will begin to chip away at that and destroy it. that i inevitable. i member the terrible row that took place, the terrible ongoing argument, when it was first pose that we should get rid of grammar school. that situate could be replicate. absolute. my hon friend ha made the point much more succinct than i could have done. that i the bedrock of my argument: there must be an admissions policy that affect all school and cannot be left exclusive to the governor of a school. i do not wish to be rude, but the hon gentleman i not a testament to hi own educate. he doe not list to what i say. the point that i was make about a community was not about educate, but about the way in which community work together over a wide spectrum of experience, ethnicity and age. i consider that the bill ha enormous potential to create a serious breakdown in social cohesion - my i just finish the sentence? then i shall be light to allow my hon friend to intervene. it seem to me that the strong bulwark against that serious breakdown i to ensure that we have an admissions policy that i fair in the broad sense, a suggest by the hon member for brighton, pavilion. i entire agree, and we must take that serious. we have come so far in so many way in this country. i know that the hon member for kingswood agree with me, but over the past 13 year i have seen a transformation of the school in my constituency and a transformation of the educational level of pupil in my constituency, and that seem to be crease. there are variably benefit in such circumstance, because of the wide variety of people whom our children meet. the variate in culture, language and tradition feed to school in a way that ha an intrinsically posit effect not on on the children educate, but on the quality and stability of life in this country. i am a duct of the 11 - plus, and i member distinct what happen at the time. i live in a very small town. i was probably relate to two third of the people there, and everyone knew me and my entire family. the result of the 11 - plus came in. a i walk to school people ask me, "" have you passe? "" and i said, "" i don't know. "" "" oh, "" they said, "" you've fail. "" i went home for lunch. the brown envelope had arrive; i had passe. i went back. in the intervene time, my mother had run around and told everyone that i had passe. what i most shock to me, however - i did not realise it at the time, but i realise it now - i the attitude of that adult whom i had known all my life. i must say in fair to them that they had always look out for me and mine and our, because at that time there was a community culture of look out for our children. they had change in a second their view of what i was cap of and of what i was a a human bee. if govern member real wish to turn that burden to the shoulder of 11 - year - old children, i throw up my hand in despair because i do not know what they want from educate or what they expect of our children. no, i would not accept that, because the bill i allow a minute numb of people who are engage in deliver publicly fund educate to our children over a period of time to decide on their admissions policy. they can decide on everything. it seem that they have no need to consult anyone, and if they make a decision and there i a little trouble local, they then go to the secretary of state. many of u can member that under a previous conservative govern there were great difficulty with planning proposal. planning was always a terrible problem, and the govern of the day simply rubber - stamped the proposal they wish to proceed. how many bill have been enact in this place, the considered consequence of which have create the necessity for this house to come back again and either write a new bill or add an amend to the exist legislate? to assure the hon gentleman, i have been extreme public about what i regard a the intrinsic potential for huge damage in this bill. that i an extreme salient point, and one i left wonder why the bill ha to be rush through in such a short space of time. i personal have receive no comfort from the minister when it ha been point out during this afternoon bate that we are running to the long summer holiday and he ha ply, "" well, work i go on and school will open in september. "" we do not know which school they are. i am secret hop that the minister will, with the b will in the world and not because of hi own individual failure, be prove wrong on this matte, a hi secretary of state was when he made hi f vary announcement on which school would or would not be in the build school for the future programme. somebody else who doe not list - you are not the listen party, are you? the bill measure would take u back to a position to which we real should not want to turn. a we all know, we are live in an ever more competitive world, and the great national source we have i our people - their talent, their energy, their ability, their creativity. the future of this country i dependent upon our young people, and on our bee able to deliver to them the b possible educate, but it must be the b possible educate we can deliver to all our children and young people, not just a select, or select, few. so i sincere hope that the amendment that have already been present will be accept by the committee, because this i the heart of the bill and the committee should reject the bill a it stand. sure the hon gentleman would also acknowledge that there ha been an explosion across the whole country of parent buy additional educational facility for their children at the point when they have to sit a select examination, and not always in a secondary or a grammar school. that kind of pressure, which i bee exert on our children, i a pressure too far. we hear about that in respect of standard assess test. why do we not hear about it in term of the pressure on children whose choice of school must be via selection?",1,0.062,0.196,0.999

it would not be in this country national interest. a the hon member for stroud point out, more than half our trade - i think it i 60 % - i with our fellow eu member state. we therefore have a national interest in the success of the euro; we have a national interest in grow in the german, french, danish, dutch, spanish and portuguese economy, for example; and we have a national interest in the prosperity of the european region. it follow that measure will be require to stabilise the financial institute in the eu, to stop the collapse of bank, to deal with a crisis such a we have seen in greece, and to deal with the change in the irish govern that i likely to happen in the next few week or perhaps to respond to the welcome turn to govern of a man who was a finance minister under the excellent labour govern in ireland, ruairi quinn. in light of that, it will be in our national interest to assist the stability and success of the other european economy. amend 8 should be oppose vigorous, because it i not in the interest of this country. the hon gentleman and i have been bate these issue for near 20 year. we have never agree on matte relate to the european ion, and i do not think that we are go to do so now. i do not believe that it will benefit our country if the european ion and the european economy implode, a the hon gentleman seem to wish them to do. certain there are problem in some - not all - european ion economy, and some, include the german economy, are grow quite rapid. at the same time, the world economic centres are shift, overwhelming to asia but also to other part of the world, and a a result we a europeans will face a very difficult period in the come year and decade. we need to think careful about what will happen if the british economy i speculate against in the next 10, 15 or 20 year, and - given that the coalition govern are preside over a turn to cession - about what will happen to the long - term future of the economy if, a the hon gentleman wish, the european economy fail and the european ion implodes. mr caton - i was about to seek your advice, mr caton. i would love to become involve in a bate on the merit of european co - operate and a new bretton wood, and numerous other such issue, but i do not think that they are cover by clause 6. the question with which the bill front u are "" i it necessary? "", "" doe it do what it say on the tin? "", and "" what will be the effect of it and, in particular, of the amendment and clause 6 if they become law? "" in my opine, either this i a recipe for litigate and a lawyers' paradise, a other have said both on second read and today, or it i irrelevant. indeed, it may be both: it may be irrelevant in essence, but may none the less serve a a mechanism enable people to opt for judicial view and litigate when referendum are not pose on certain aspect of decisions made in the european ion and the council of minister. we are experiencing a difficult period in this country. very few politician have had the courage to stand up to the murdoch press and the eurosceptic media, and the capitulate of the liberal democrat over the last few months, a they have change their previous approach to the one to which they have sign up in the coalition, further weak the voice of pro - european people in the country. perhaps when he make hi own speech the hon gentleman will be able to clarify whether the liberal democrat are still in favour of a "" big bang referendum "", a was suggest on some occasion, whether - a happen with the lisbon treaty - they will vote in three separate way on any of the issue that arise from clause 6, and whether the liberal democrat in the other place will vote in line with their front - bench colleague here or will also be split in three directions. i believe that the measure before u are not necessary and should be reject. i shall vote against clause 6 and the amendment concerning, in particular, the european financial stability mechanism, which i think would be positive damage to the future of our country. just for the cord, i it not a fact that the outgo chancellor would have consult the then shadow chancellor, who was about to become chancellor, at that time? so rather than inadvertent give the wrong impression, perhaps we should put it on the cord that in that transition period it would have been necessary and proper for the previous chancellor to be in discussion with hi successor, so that there would be no ambiguity about what would happen.",1,0.095,0.27,0

"" i get very little of the latte and a lot of the former. in different constituency around the land, some member have a lot of immigrate case. i have had on about three immigrate case during my time a a member of parliament. casework vary between constituency, and it i not appropriate to legislate directly in relate to that. i think "" sceptical "" might be the hon gentleman middle name. i see he i smiling - i have manage to get a smile out of him; that must be a first. he i now try not to smile. now he i laugh. the on point i would make to the hon gentleman i that there i no academic evidence, and probably never will be. all that we have i anecdotal evidence. i mere off my own evidence - i have not seen my work load diminish compare with that of my predecessor, who did not have a welsh assembly to tend with. the hon gentleman i right that a constituency with a small numb of people might mean that the member concern ha few people contact them, but it might also mean that access to the member for constituent i more difficult and that it involve considerable travelling around the constituency. anyway, that i a matte for a different bate. the right hon and learn member for kensington referred to the issue of whether there should be an english parliament. he i right to argue that there i a dang that we would end up with two government. who would take possession of down street? presumably, we would have a set of english minister, in addition to british minister, and so on. i am not sure that i the direction in which british voter want to go. the hon member for w worcestershire referred to the fact that on the one occasion when we had a referendum on whether there should be devolve responsibility within the english region, people decide, large because they did not want more politician, not to go down that route. in parenthesis, let me say briefly that i hear regular, not from the right hon and learn member for kensington but from other, that this i the mother of parliament. i again say that john bright meant that england was the mother of parliament and that it was a very difficult and complicate birth. the effortless english superiority that sometime arise in these bate i fortunate. the right hon and learn gentleman referred to wale, and i was mind of a story, which may not be apocryphal, of charlotte church sing before george w. bush when he was president - a meet of two great mind, obvious. when charlotte church was introduce to the president, he ask, "" where are you from? "" she said, "" wale. "" he ask, "" what state i that in? "", and she said "" terrible. "" discussion about issue such a this are not always form by great intelligence. the right hon and learn gentleman mention the possibility of an english grand committee. it ha been suggest in the past that such a committee should sit in the chamber, because it would obvious have a significant numb of member. during the last parliament we cuss the possibility of regional grand committee and argument were present both for and against the idea, but it ha fall by the wayside. i am not convince by the right hon and learn gentleman argument in favour of a require for a double majority. neither house ha ever operate a system of secondary mandate. it i true that innovate i sometime a good the, but i think that it would lead to fusion in this stance. i am afraid that i am go to appoint the right hon and learn gentleman now. he expect me to argue that a govern who lost a piece of legislate would fall, but i am not go to argue that at all. in fact, the dang i that a we move toward an elect second chamber - and over the past few week we have seen both side of the second chamber behave almost exact like an elect chamber - we will reach a point at which there will be absolute no check on the power of the execute. there will be no check by virtue of the time that the second chamber can take to lay legislate, and no check in this house because, by definition, the govern have a majority. we may have to address that problem through the way in which we interpret the stand order of the house. i shall deal late with an issue that relate directly to the point of the bill, and i think that the right hon and learn gentleman will then understand why i believe there i a problem. he i now fuse, but i hope that i shall be able to rescue him from hi fusion in a moment or two. a i said to the hon member for w worcestershire, this i an age - old issue. there i a meretricious argument, which the hon lady steer away from today - although she dangle it in front of u a little bit - that it i patent absurd for member whose constituent will not be affect by an individual piece of legislate to be able to vote on it. that i, at any rate, a paraphrase of something that she said. my response i "" all that glister i not gold. "" if we decide that member can vote on on matte that affect their constituent directly - or even indirect, i suppose - we end up with the question of who run the country. at any one moment, on any one piece of legislate, there i certainty, and in the case of finance bill in particular there i a real problem. the issue i not just what the govern pose, but what member can or cannot amend. some money bill have effect on in england, but the dang i that a money bill could be amend in a way that cause it to have an imply elsewhere. there are money bill attach to many piece of legislate. there will be money bill in relate to the educate bill and the national heal service bill, for stance. however, i think that the hon lady i referring to finance bill. it i true that the vast majority of finance bill have imply throughout the unite kingdom, although obvious there will be modify in relate to scotland if the scotland bill i passe. element of a future finance bill would not apply in scotland. indeed, element of a finance bill today already do not apply in scotland, northern ireland or wale. my second point i that it i phenomenal difficult to be clear about what constitute the territorial extent not just of a particular piece of legislate, but of it transition through the house. it would seem on the face of it that, for stance, the bill that became the heal act 2006 was pure an england bill. most people would consider that to be the case. the bill made vision in relate to smoke - free premise, the purpose bee to ban smoke in public place in england. on 14 february 2006 the house bate new clause 5, which place the original clause 3. it provide that "" the appropriate national authority may make regulations provide for specify description of premise, or specify area within specify description of premise, not to be smoke - free "". it then list a series of place that might be exempt. subsection, for example, state: "" if both a club premise certificate and a premise licence authorising the consumption of alcohol on the premise have effect in respect of any premise, those premise are to be treat for the purpose of this section a if on the premise licence had effect "". i will, but i shall want to turn to my specific argument. no, it i an argument against it. i member clear the row that took place in both the chamber and the clerk office about whether the way in which the amendment to a heal bill were bee select would mean that wale was or was not cover. because most member want to move the vision that would allow the secretary of state to exempt private members' club in england, they actual move the vision that allow an exemption for private members' club in wale. it may well be that the welsh assembly would have want to do that itself anyway, but it had no choice. it could not make such a vision. i can tell the hon lady that that row was quite vociferous. my point i this: i do not think it i possible to be clear. the original legislate might be clear, but people might want to amend it, and why should they not be able to do so? if the parliamentary draftspeople say, "" this bill will cover on england "", the numb of bill go through the house will have to be double, if not treble, because there will have to be a separate wale bill and a separate scotland bill. but who get to decide the interpretation of what apply and what doe not apply? that i the problem. a series of issue arise. a decision i made by parliamentary draftspeople, or clerk, or the speak. that would bring them to the bate, which would be a mistake. i want to g the reason why i think the bill i bee introduce. although it i fascinate to know the territorial extent of any bill or clause, the on purpose of knowing that must sure be, a the hon lady said, to ensure that member of the house vote on on legislate that directly affect them. that i a misguide intention. in practice, that would mean that we end up with more bill, and second and third read and committee stage. if we decide that english mps can vote on on english legislate, who will vote on welsh clause? just welsh mps? would on welsh mps be able to attend the committee to take the bill through? i think that we have never had a welsh secretary of state for wale under a conservative govern, although i may be wrong. we would have to allow the minister to sit on the committee but they would not be able to vote on their own legislate, which seem patent absurd. no, i honest think that the hon lady i complete naive in relate to this matte. she said at the beginning of h speech that she thought that it was a fundamental principle that mps should be able to vote on on those the that affect their constituent. that i the on purpose of have such a vision in any legislate. if she introduce a piece of legislate or a stand order - i will come to parliamentary privilege in a moment - that would quire mps not to vote on a piece of legislate, or that would shame people to not vote on a piece of legislate, she will create a real problem. if we assert that on english mps can take part in the proceed on english legislate, t amendment, amend bill, seek to speak and vote on that legislate - that i where h bill i drive u - there will be a problem for english legislate, not least because large numb of scottish and welsh mps have been english minister deal with large english matte. there are and have been scottish and welsh minister in, for example, the department of heal and the department for educate who have large dealt with matte that f on to england. i think that the hon lady ha just let the cat out of the bag. that i the whole point of h argument, i it not? there i no other reason to introduce such a measure. the on reason i to shame people. that i what the hon lady want to do. i think that she i effective say that she doe not want me a a welsh mp to vote on anything that she believe to be an english - on matte. i that what she believe? sorry, i am slight cross - eyed. i meant the hon member for sou northamptonshire. although i am sure that you would not mind, mr speak. it i not a libel. it i not like bee call an english member when you are not an english member. we lost bad in the rugby last week so we are still somewhat wound on these matte. i recognise that the hon member for w worcestershire ha dress h bill up so that it doe not look like it i move in that direction, but many member might on support the bill because they want it to move in that direction. a i said early, i understand that some people are concern about the issue in the country. however, i cannot think of a single parliament in the world, include spain and many other country - this i not the on argument that i would use in relate to this - where there i asymmetric devolution and mps cannot vote on every piece of legislate that i brought before them. a the right hon and learn member for kensington said, to go down that route i a nationalist argument - not a in british nationalist, but a in welsh, scottish or irish nationalist - and will unpick the ion in the end. therefore, if the hon member for w worcestershire real believe in the ion, it i a bit difficult to advance that argument. i would like to see the issue address in different way - a it ha been address in other country. for example, the role of the second chamber need to be look at. it ha been embarrass that the vast majority of people who have been appoint to the second chamber in the past few year have been from london and the sou - east of england. that i almost inevitable when we have an appointment system. i would prefer to move to an elect system, where we had more people represent the whole of the uk. it might be possible to vise a better answer to the w lothian question through form of the second chamber on an elect basis. however, a the hon lady ha said, the whole busy of parliamentary privilege come to play. it ha been a fundamental assumption from when the first commoner were allow to attend parliamentary proceed under simon de montfort in 1258 that grievance that they present on behalf of the people should be able to be present without any difference between one and the other member. i thought that go back to the 13th century might stimulate the hon gentleman. simon de montfort invite four knight from each of the shire and six from yorkshire in 1258 to present in parliament their grievance on behalf of other. we do not know that all the knight attend. of the one who did attend, we on know that because they present expense and had them paid, so this problem ha been with u since mauge vavasour had hi payment made in michaelmas 1258. it was a significant moment. the burgesses obvious arrive aft 1258, though early in the 13th century there were occasion when some burgesses from the cinque port were invite, and some from those city where there were a large numb of jewish resident were brought to parliament to bate specific issue. well, not all 37 shire had presentation, and they certain did not have that a of right. i am perfect happy to bate this at another time, but for now mr speak ha got that slight fascinate but also slight irritate face on. it would be very dangerous to mantle the fundamental principle of the equality of all member of this house. that i why i think that, in the end, the direction of travel the hon member for w worcestershire i move in with this bill i an fortunate one. a i have said, legislate i about not just what it doe, but the declaratory effect that it ha. the hon lady referred to the tend consequence of h bill, but it would also have unintended consequence. a h colleague, the hon member for sou northamptonshire, ha already in effect told u, press lease will be sent out the moment the bill come to force condemn some member for taking part in bate and vote on matte that the bill declare a bee for england on. i presume that there would also be condemnation of english mps taking part in bate and vote on legislate that apply on to wale. if we are go to reduce the numb of member of parliament for wale to 30, it will be difficult to take such legislate through effective if there are not enough back benchers to be able to make proper form decisions about the measure under discussion. the direction of travel the hon member for w worcestershire i taking u down i fortunate. i also think there will be fortunate direct consequence, in that the numb of bill will crease, which will make the more difficult for u, and the numb of clause will also crease. we will end up with worse legislate because, a the hon lady ha said, draftsmen will be require to try to provide absolute clarity that measure apply specifically to england, for example, or to wale alone. that was go to be my last sentence, but i will allow the hon gentleman to intervene. which specific declaration i the hon gentleman referring to? such declaration do not specify whether a bill i exclusive english, welsh or northern irish, or apply to all four territory or just two - or whatever. there ha not been a problem thus far, and that i why i do not think there i any reason to make change through legislate. i am even more sceptical about this bill than the hon member for peterborough normal i about everything. if it proceed to second read, we will want to scrutinise and amend it robust. a other member have reveal, there are major problem with these measure that the hon member for w worcestershire ha not consider. but i the difficulty not that, for the most part, government introduce legislate in our system and a govern who were nervous about their majority would simply ensure that bill contain separate clause relate to wale, to northern ireland and to scotland, so we would not be any further forward? one should assume that government will be scrupulous. hon. member are always scrupulous, but government, in their corporate manage of taking busy through the house, might be scrupulous. there i the myth that the previous labour govern did not have a majority in england, but they had the majority of seat in england. i say gently to the hon gentleman that the bill will not solve the problem. it i the same now. ye, they did. that ha not always been my experience of the t office, which i often directional and forceful in say that one cannot t a particular question in, for example, welsh question. in such case, it i often drawn to row. early, i suggest that labour won more vote than the conservative in the 2005 election. actual, we were 70,000 vote short but 92 seat ahead. i keep on think up more reason why i like that double mandate, so i will suggest another one: one of the reason why, traditional, we have grant that a bill should be given a second read i so that it can be amend. quite often, hon member will allow a bate on second read to proceed because they want to amend something. that i the dang. many hon member might want to amend a bill to include welsh or scottish vision, but they might have been prohibit from taking part in the bate on second read, and that rather conflict with the whole purpose of such a bate. the hon gentleman start the quotation but did not finish it: "" oh! what a tangle web we weave when first we practice to deceive "". i am sure that he i not suggest that the bill i deceiving. and the french. the french very regular fuse "" anglais "" with "" britannique "". ha the hon gentleman had the follow experience, a i have had in the past couple of week? a a welsh member of parliament, i have had a lot of e - mails and correspondence from my constituent on the issue of sell off forest. that doe not apply in wale, but the issue i deep felt by many in my constituency. i hope that i am not break a private confidence when i say that vernon bogdanor told me that he thought that the minister, when he was hi student, was very clever and bright and clear destine for great the, but that it was a shame that he had fall among thieve of late. well, this i a grand bate, isn't it? the truth i that, all too often, the welsh grand committee ha been a pretty futile body. it i all the more futile when the govern g it matte to cuss that it member do not want to cuss, and when those decisions are made on by the govern and not by the committee member. a clear example i to be found in the explanatory note to the next bill that we will consider. in relate to the territorial extent and apply, the note state: "" the bill extend to england and wale. the term of clause 1, however, mean that it will on take effect within england.

904,"it i a pleasure to follow the hon member for sou thanet. i absolute agree with hi last point: we must all commit ourselves to find a sustain, long - term solute that meet the need of all those with care need and not just the small group whom this bill address. let me start by make it clear that there are two other point on which we all agree. i am sure that we all agree on the absolute importance of the idea that any form should facilitate people remain in their own home for a long a they can. for the group of people who will benefit from the bill, that will clear be the case. we must ensure that that principle i at the heart of the final form that we achieve. the second absolute important principle, which this bill address, i the value of reablement. the bill recognises that at present we do not do reablement well enough. there are patch of good practice around the country where authority have been able to demonstrate the enormous potential save and, more important, the dramatic improve in people live of committing proper to reablement. however, in too many part of the country reablement i not provide well enough. at it b, the bill provide an incentive to the system to ensure that reablement take place. that i a good the. follow the bate today and on second read we still have three core concerns, the first of which i affordability and sustainability, particular given the trend toward an ageing population. we use to be attack by the govern for our previous commitment to free personal care. two year ago, we move that commitment. i took a paper through our party conference, because i reach the conclusion that one could not, in reality, argue the case for free personal care given the demographic change that we are witness. the green paper recognises that point, but the bill shift in that direction. that cause me real concern, because the cost of the duty to provide free care to the relevant group of people will keep rise. the govern have set a cap on the amount that they will tribute, so the other potential pernicious impact i that if the re of the fund ha to come from local authority a the numb continue to crease, something else will have to g. my fear i that, owe to this duty, other vulnerable people who benefit from care from local authority on a discretionary basis will end up lose their care, or part of it. if the demand i high than the impact assess ha conclude, the impact will again be on local authority here and now, and the potential consequence could be very damage. our second core concern i that the proposal i a partial solute. i think that everyone recognises that. the government case i that it i a bridge to form, but a long a it remain the on form to have happen, and until we have more comprehensive form, it will have perverse consequence. a the right hon member for charnwood ha made very clear, it will provide an incentive for local authority to push people to care home. that i not a good the, because it will change behaviour and will benefit one group of people but not another. another perverse incentive was mention on second read by the hon member for sou thanet - it will provide a incentive to people who are consider insure to protect themselves in old age. another dang, or consequence, of the fact that the proposal i a partial solute i the inherent unfair in the bill. why should we choose to support and provide free care to one group of people - those with critical need who are car for at home - but not another group who, through no fault of their own, end up have to have their critical need met in care home because they simply cannot be car for at home? that i perverse. why should one group benefit and not another? the govern have provide no answer to that. our third core concern i whether what i pose would be the most effect use of public fund. the green paper strong make the case that in any form we have a duty to ensure that we use public fund to the b possible effect to achieve the b outcome for all those who have care need, but the bill doe not do that. the impact assess confirm specifically that the group of elder people who would benefit most from the proposal would be the wealthy. the secretary of state shake hi head, but the impact assess make that clear. at paragraph 5. 21, it state: "" the recipient of free personal care are believe to fall to the bottom, 2nd and 3rd quintiles because even the wealthy old people are in the middle of the come distribute of society at large. "" in other word, the wealthy elder people are not the wealthy people in society, but they are the main beneficiary of the bill. i find it bizarre that a labour govern should choose to use avail public fund to benefit most the wealthy old people, given that there are many other with acute care need. the conclusion must be that that i not the b use of avail public fund. i am also concern that the bill ha been oversold by the govern. the minister again quote a figure of 400,000 for the total numb of people to benefit from free care, and that of course include those who would benefit from reablement. however, when one look at the numb of new recipient of free care at home, the real figure i 110,000. the govern do not use that figure at all in their pronouncement. the govern say that the bill protect the care of those current receive free care, but it i hard to envisage circumstance in which those in critical need who are benefit from care on a mean - test basis would lose that care. therefore, it i somewhat ingenuous to argue that there i some great benefit for that group. the new recipient of free care will total just 110,000. a the hon member for sou thanet made clear, that i a relative small group, compare with the total numb of people with care need who will have to be support in any final form of the system. final, i find that it strain the use of language to scribe this bill a a bridge to form. a a sceptic, the hon member for sou thanet made the b possible case for support the bill but, whatever happen to it, we must all be committed to a more fundamental form of the system. i think that we are all agree on that. i want to repeat the case that i made on second read. in this pre - election period, there i a real and overwhelm need for all party to put aside their differences and to join in a process charge specifically with build and achieve consensus on this matte. i know that that would be support massive by those group outside parliament who represent people with real care need. such a consensus would have the benefit of facilitate form in the next parliament, and it would also put pressure on whoever win the next election to ensure that form take place. the hon member for sou thanet i absolute right to say that the urgency of complete the form process i overwhelm. we must not allow this bill to lay that.",1,0.256,0.5,1

949,"i shall not detain the house, because i am sure we all want to proceed to the next group of new clause and amendment. the liberal democrat will support the new clause, because, a we have said from the outset, we consider the whole system of target to be nonsense. the idea that precise 50 p cent. of young people no more, no less should go to university i absurd. the target will probably be achieve quite easily anyway; it ha already been achieve in scotland, and the chance are that it will be achieve in england in the near future regardless of whether the govern take any action. what we should be do i decide how many university place we ought to be provide, and for whom they ought to be provide. we have long believe that place should be provide for all who have the ability, potential and qualify to make proper use of university course. we are particular happy with new clause 1 because the conservative, who in committee table an equivalent amend pose the removal of the clause in the bill that insist on fair, have now include subsection in the new clause. it provide that the system of choose between applicant must be fair and non - discriminatory. that addition make all the difference: it enable u to support the new clause. while we are think about fair, we should bear in mind that a - level are not the on measure of ability and potential. i was somewhat surprise, but nevertheless light, to find in committee that the conservative held that view a well. there had been some concern about the issue over the past year. some dependent school had seem to think that a - level were the on important measure of ability, and that those with the right a - level should be chosen on those ground alone. that, of course, ha become impossible in the case of our most prestigious university: so many applicant are achieve three or four a grade that it i impossible to choose between them pure on that basis. i do not think that those from state school necessarily get better degree. what i certain true i that those from state school who have low a - level grade tend to do at least a well a those from dependent school who have high grade. i do not think that that i quite the point that the hon gentleman was make, but it i my reason for think that a - level grade should not represent the on way of choose between applicant. if we do not have other mechanism, our most prestigious university will not have the opportunity to admit applicant with great ability and potential who come from state school and whose a - level grade may not be a good a those of other in their age group. i suspect that, in fact, we are all misunderstand each other. i think that what i was say i exact what the hon gentleman ha just said. those from state school will not necessarily get better degree than those from dependent school, but those from state school with low a - level grade tend to end up with the same degree a those from dependent school with high grade. i think that we are all say much the same the, and that i should now make some progress. at present, dependent school are sell themselves large on their ability to produce better a - level grade than state school for pupil with the same ability. university should therefore take the opportunity of choose state school applicant with low grade, rather than those from dependent school; but the choice must be made on the basis of a numb of criteria. past exam success clear make a difference, and it i one of the measure that university can use fair not just in respect of a - level, but in respect of early exam. current test of potential along the line of the american sats are a possible method of differentiate. the apply form itself may g university a hint, and pupil could perhaps send example of written work to show what they had achieve in the past. interview are another possibility, a are teachers' assessment. if teach are at all fair in their assessment, the b way of judge the ability and potential of young people may be what i said by those who have known them b at school. new clause 1 would, i hope, produce a fair way of choose university student than the method current use in some university. it i on fair to add, however, that a certain level of source would have to be invest. it i quick and simple for university to choose between applicant on the basis of a - level grade; if these more complex and subtle, but fair, method are adopt, university must put in more money than they do at present. new clause 2 would move from the welsh assembly some of it right to determine how university admissions are handle. that clear conflict with the whole principle of devolution to the assembly. i should like the maximum numb of power to be devolve, and i believe that these power should be include. no, i am not suggest that welsh university should not have a fair choice of applicant. what i am say i that it should be up to the assembly to determine how it will put pressure on university to employ a fair and sensible way of discriminate between applicant. we in this parliament should not make that decision. i am not sure whether anyone will speak to amendment no. 99 and 100. the hon member for nottingham, north, who table them, did not seem to want to speak a moment ago. in case he doe speak, however, let me say that we consider the amendment objectionable but probably superfluous. i suspect that offa would work more or less in that way in any event. we see no great need for the amendment, but we have no great objection to them.",1,0.216,0.457,0

party support, but we had 666 amendment from the lord, of which 665 were govern amendment. there was no filibuster, but we had the chance to consider on 80 amendment in the time allocate under the government guillotine. one of the direct result was that we had to introduce subsequent legislate to correct the howl in relate to the imprint at the bottom of election literature. doe the hon gentleman agree that the govern cannot impose orderly on the programming of lord amendment? there will be no programming committee to deal with lord amendment, for which the mechanism will be exact the same a the old guillotine. doe not the hon gentleman agree that that must be the interpretation at which one arrive aft a tail read of the motions' text? i turn to the point that i made early on lord amendment, and i would be grateful for the hon gentleman comment on that. nobody will determine the programming in that regard apart from the lead of the house or the minister in charge of the bill in question. doe not that fly in the face of the intention that the hon gentleman say the modernisation committee had in come up with these proposal? i am grateful to the hon lady. i am sure that she speak with great sincerity, and i accept h critique of some of our practice, but she will appreciate that - - especial when measure are bee introduce by a govern aft a period during which that govern use the very tactic that she now deplore - - the opposite are bound to greet such measure with a certain suspicion. that i all the more inevitable given that on all the real measure that could be taken to modernise procedure in the house, we have heard nothing from the lead of the house. the conservative party ha contribute by publish a major document with proposal on the subject. this ha been a good bate. it struck me a much more measure than the bate in which we first cuss the question of mote of this type, and perhaps rather sombre in tone. i shall turn to that in a moment. one reason why this bate ha been more good - humoured than the last may be the maid speech that we have heard this afternoon. i especial enjoy those of the hon member for glasgow, maryhill and for dundee, east, and, of course, of my hon friend the member for witney, whose constituency i know well. he succeed in depict it in short word but with a great deal of feel. all those new member are welcome. it i, perhaps, especial apposite that they should have made maid speech this afternoon when we are bate issue that touch our future, our existence and our relevance. for what concerns u today i not just the programming mote in itself: a ha been said, it i link with the overall direction in which the house i go. hon. member speak of modernisation and the need for it. i am second to none in say that there are numerous area in which the practice of the house, and it efficiency, could do with view; but the key issue for u to consider i whether we are go down the right pa in carry out that task, or whether we are simply passe an ad hoc measure whose purpose seem large to be to suit the need of the execute rather than those of the house. i hope this i not an om, but one the about the labour speak today struck me a noteworthy. let me for the moment leave aside the hon member for cambridge, who made an interesting speech with much of which i had little difficulty in agreeing. a far a i could see, not one labour member of the select committee on the modernisation of the house of commons - - apart from the hon member for burnley, who contribute briefly to the early bate on the guillotine mote - - spoke today, although the committee commendation i bee present to the house. yet this i suppose to be a bate initiate by the house itself. my impression i that labour member who have made valuable contribute today have been very guard in their reception of the proposal. i shall say more about those contribute short. no one express great enthusiasm except the hon member for cambridge, and even she had some reservation. we saw a succession of critic on both side of the house, the on two enthusiast bee the lead of the house and the hon member for north cornwall, who was a member of the committee. i am sorry that he i not present now. i do not want to spend too much time on deferred vote. i agree with the hon member for stoke - on - trent, central, who right said that it was the less of the two issue that we are consider. i regret the fact that we brought the deferred vote procedure to operate, because it show that the house i approach it problem wrong. it may be convenient to vote aft 10 pm, and that may be a reflection of bad programming. however, rather than address how we could better programme or modernise our procedure so a to minimise such vote, we have committed and will continue to commit the great error of separate vote from bate. there may not be many hon member present in the chamber during bate, but at least there i a centrality to those activities, which i maintain when vote follow bate. the previous exception to the rule that we vote aft bate were few. it ha now been turn to a rubber - stamping exercise carry out on a wednesday afternoon, and it i difficult to escape the conclusion that for some people it i a relative painless way of improve their vote cord. if we lose the centrality of the chamber and it activities, we will lose something precious. we are not social worker in our constituency - - that may be a role that we have taken on, but it was not the role that we were elect to undertake. our role i in the process of bate in parliament, and even the gossip in the tea room i important in that exchange of political view because it bring u together. if we compartmentalise ourselves - - a the deferred vote process tend to do - - we do ourselves and the country a great service. i hope that we will visit deferred vote, and that when we do, we will have the courage to tackle the problem that it was design to address in a different way. the proposal on programme mote goes much further than the system that we had last year. i was particular struck by the contribute of the hon member for stoke - on - trent, central and for cambridge, who acknowledge that much more need to be done than mere tinker with programme mote. i shall not run through a list of all my hon friend who made tell contribute, but my hon friend the member for aldridge - brownhills, who i a great exponent of our parliamentary tradition, should be listen to with care when he say that we are paddle ourselves to irrelevance and oblivion. that i how this will be perceive. it i all very well have programme mote. i welcome them, and i have sat on stand committee that have been subject to programme mote. i acknowledge to the lead of the house that if the system of programming sub - committee that he i establish work, it could be a great improve. however, i am bound to flag up my anxiety. first, the secrecy surround the process i all very well, but how can we learn from it if we are deny access to the sub - committees' operate and deliberate? aft all, most parliamentarian learn from their mistake, a do most people in their daily live, yet those exclude from a sub - committee deliberate will have no idea whether it got it right or not, except anecdotal. it i scandalous that we are sett up such a structure with no transparency. whole area will be of no concern to the committee and their programming sub - committee, because much of this programming busy relate to matte dealt with aft the busy ha turn to the floor of the house or when it come back from the other place. in the last parliament, the govern extensive use the house of lord to rewrite and amend legislate. i see labour member shake their head. i sat on the committee that consider the political party, election and referendum bill. that bill command support from both side of the house and was acknowledge when it left committee to be in a woeful defect state. the govern, perfect proper, amend it in the house of lord. however, although that bill was all the more the responsibility of the house since it concern the electoral process, we had virtual no opportunity to consider it in tail when it turn to this place. the guillotine that was impose then was identical to what we will have if we pass the programming mote under considerate. i cannot see the difference. in both case a ministerial decision determine how long should be allow for bate and the programming take place according. there i no indicate a to whether there will be an opportunity for put or consultation of any kind. i fail to understand how that can be an improve on the exist system or how it will be to the house's credit. during today bate, one hon member aft another ha highlight the central point that it i wrong to pass legislate that ha not been scrutinised. we have heard a great deal about filibuster and about hon member who hold up proceed. we have to face the fact that with hundred of member of parliament and, thank good, with some who will not slavish follow the whip, there will be people with bee in their bonnet. some of them may be reasonable, a may be those who have lobby them, but they are entitle to a hear if this place i to have any relevance. the hon member for stoke - on - trent, central right point out that from about 1866 onwards power start to ebb away from this place to the execute. it i at least worth remember that in the 19th century considerable tolerance was accord to windbag member of parliament who drone to the night about their pet subject. ultimate, that was a matte of forbearance by the execute, whom the lead of the house represent just a i hope that he will represent our interest across the chamber. that forbearance was base on the principle that it was necessary to have exhaust discussion because if we do not, a the hon member for crewe and nantwich so right said, people may start to sort to extra - parliamentary method to achieve their end. we should member what happen a recent a last autumn when large numb of people took part in a test that paralysed this country and brought about a change in the government taxation policy. it may be thought that that was to the advantage of my party, but it frighten me. it seem to be a classic example of a breakdown of parliamentary democracy. i speak a someone with a half - french background; there, i am afraid that the notion of parliamentary democracy are not well develop. in that country, such action i an institutionalised phenomenon and i seen a the on way to bring home to the execute and the elite who govern the country the people satisfaction at the way in which the country i bee run. merciful, we have been free of that, but when i look at what i bee pose today, i am left with the feel that this i another nail in the coffin. my hon friend make powerful and compelling point, but i would go further, in this sense. many have congratulate the lead of the house on hi appearance at the patch box, and i do, too. he ha an opportunity, but the question i, will it be taken? if indeed the govern wish to bring forward proposal, along the line of those of the norton committee, for substantial form of how parliament can hold the execute to account, he will have support, and if the such a the programme mote before u were part of those proposal, it would be much easy to be assure about the government intention. but at the moment, every time that modernisation come along, it i simply another nail in the coffin of the few remain - - doubtless sometime abuse and tawdry - - power left to back benchers to make a noise about something. i tell the lead of the house that if this i the b that we are go to get, we shall be in a sad and sorry place by the end of this parliament. for myself, i will vote against these mote. i believe that they are wrong. the on circumstance in which i could support them would be if they were part of a total package that had been brought about by co - operate. the willing to co - operate exist, but the will on the govern side appear wholly absent.",0,0.137,0.311,1
