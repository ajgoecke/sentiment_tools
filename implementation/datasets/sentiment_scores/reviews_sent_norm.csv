3,"This is a beautiful middle grade story about best friends, Sussy and Guy, fourth graders who do everything together. They end getting a spotted lizard, name her Matylda, and make up a warrior origin story for her. Shortly after, an accident changes their lives, and Sussy decides she must love Matylda so deeply and care for her so perfectly in order to hold onto Guy and his memory. This story was so incredibly touching and beautiful, and Sussy's journey through her grief moved at just the right pace. Side note: I cried through most of this book.

17,"This is an alphabet book for readers who know their stuff. A is for salad? I can almost hear the chorus of ""NOOOOO!"" coming from a preschool storytime group. A isn't for salad. However, there is an alligator holding a bowl of salad in the corresponding picture. Savvy listeners will appreciate the goofy humor of Lester's book, where ""B is for Viking,"" and, my favorites, ""X and Y are not important letters. Never use them."" This is best for the kids at the top of our age range, probably 4 year olds. They would need to be old enough to appreciate the joke that is the whole layout of this book, and to know slightly more obscure animals like beavers, iguanas, and narwhals. Luckily, Lester includes an endpage that explains the joke, if readers haven't caught on beforehand. The illustrations are appropriately funky, the ""A"" on the cover is wiggling, as though it can't even sit still for you to start the book. The illustrations are cartoonish, with bold black outlines, and the animals all seem a little risque, as though you wouldn't soon find them in a ""proper"" alphabet book. This would slide right into any alphabet themed storytime, or it would go well with any book where the audience has to correct the reader (for instance, I might pair it with Don't Forget the Bacon, by Pat Hutchins.) With four year olds, a possible project idea would be to have them make their own A is for Salad letter page, picking a letter and thinking of things that don't start with that letter.",0,0.232,0.684,0.981

25,"Root, P. (2009). Paula Bunyan. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 
 0374357595 
 A new twist on a tall tale, Paula Bunyan shares the story of famous Paul Bunyan's younger sister Paula, who isn't such a little sister since she's as big as her brother. 
 This books shares many of Paula's adventures, but particularly focuses on her love of singing. A love she can't pursue because her voice is so loud that she shatters peoples windows with her volume. It is only when Paula goes into the woods that she is finally able to sing freely and make friends with the wild animals. But when Paula encounters a portion of the woods being cut down, Paula must confront a problem larger than her that has modern implications. 
 With this creation of a new character to enter into the stories of America's past, Root provides equal footing for girls since Paula is just as strong as her brother. 
 Activities to Do with the Book: 
 This would be an excellent picturebook to share if a teacher were doing a unit on American history or tall tales. The story does assume that the reader has knowledge of Paul Bunyan and his exploits, so a teacher would have to introduce him first. 
 Students could create their own characters and tall tales in response to hearing or reading this book. 
 Also, a number of classic children's songs are incorporated into the illustrations and could prompt student sing alongs. 
 On a more serious note, a teacher could talk about webs of relationships among animals and their environment and about deforestation and how it has been a developing problem for over a century. 
 Favorite Quotes: 
 ""Everyone knows about Paul Bunyan, with his woodcutter's ax and his big blue ox, Babe. But not many people know about Paula Bunyan, his little sister. Maybe ""little"" isn't the right word. After all, she was as tall as a pine tree and as strong as a dozen moose."" 
 ""It got so Paula took to humming under her breath instead of singing out loud, just so nobody would holler that she was breaking their windows or chipping their best china."" 
 ""When the bear growled, she growled right back."" 
 ""Now, folks say the mosquitoes up north are mighty bad, and I believe it's true, because one day a few hungry mosquitoes carried off Paula's bear.""

 Once I have read the two completions of Jane Austen's 
 unfinished ""Sanditon"" - I've already read ""Rebecca's Tale"", Sally Beauman's sequel to Daphne du Maurier's classic ""Rebecca"",(Goodness!!!Was that whirring sound dear Daphne spinning in her grave???)- I think I will get stuck into this sequel to ""Wind in the Willows"".And William Horwood has written not only one sequel but several!!A regular feast for the desperate lovers of the Original.(I may well be one of those!!) 
 Then I have this feeling - call it ""inspiration"" - that I might be then ready to seize my pen and scribe a sequel to.......The Bible!!!

 PS. Just remembered that Beatrix Potter ,no less, wrote a prequel to ""The Owl and the Pussy-Cat"" by Edward Lear. The book, much larger than her familiar pocket size classics,(this one has eight chapters), was published in 1930. But Beatrix was originally inspired in 1883 when aged only 17 while on a family seaside holiday at Ilfracombe in Devon where the long flight of stairs leading down to the harbour gave her the idea for a story. That story was ""The Tale of Little Pig Robinson"", 
 and she was still developing its ideas in 1901 and 1902!!She sketched a number of seaside towns for her tale including Lyme Regis in Dorset where Jane Austen holidayed and set a dramatic scene for her novel 
 ""Persuasion"" and the high sheds for drying nets came from Hastings in Sussex where Inspector Foyle made his contribution to WWII. The story explains exactly how that pig from Lear ended up on a tropical island and the Pussy-cat who helped him to seek refuge there may well be the one whose marriage ceremony he performed there 18 months after his arrival.",0,-0.161,0.357,0.978

And when she finally finds the mitten's missing mate, two mittens open up a whole new realm of possibilities.

 That being said, a lot of what I didn't care for was the author's voice. 
 My daughter was bored with it.She didn't want to read it after the first chapter. So I started to read to her, which we do every night after silent reading. Even that didn't entice her. Since neither of us enjoyed it, we decided to move on. 
 I'd like to say she's too young for this book, but she's enjoyed Julie Kagawa's Winter's Passage which is for an older audience. I'm not really sure why this didn't work for her, unless like me, the writing and author's voice didn't work for her. 
 In fact, she actually didn't feel comfortable writing a less-than-favorable review, which is why I am.

That is probably better for 6-10 year-olds (a high ratio of text to illustrations). 
 Big Kid Reaction: I loved this book. I have a soft heart for endangered species, and this book really brings awareness to the plight of animals at the hands of human development. I love that we get to know the animals through their conversations, and they tell us ""in their own words"" what they are going through, first-hand. The illustrations are colorful and fun, and help bring the story to life with a richness and biological accuracy.

Ivan, a carefree gorilla, has spent almost his entire life on display at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. Humans watch him through his glass windows. His drawings-Ivan is quite the artist-are purchased in the gift shop. He doesn't miss the jungle much, because he rarely thinks about it. And while he doesn't have any gorilla friends, he does have Stella (a wise, elderly elephant), and Bob (a blunt, stray dog who roams the mall). But when baby elephan Ruby joins their show, everything changes. 
 I can't do this book justice. It just needs to be read-by children and adults alike. The best I can do is liken it to Charlotte's Web. Each animal has a distinct personality and voice. They work together to try and carve out a better life for a newcomer. Humans are portrayed as both the enemy and the savor, but in many cases, something in between. I bawled reading this one-both happy and sad tears. Read it, read it, read it.

156,"Inhaltlich geht es hier um ein Madchen namens Melody. Sie lebt mit ihrer Oma zusammen, die eine Pension fuhrt. Leider haben sie Geldprobleme und ein schmieriger Grossunternehmer will sie zwingen ihnen die Pension zu verkaufen. Als wenn das nicht schlimm genug ware, so macht auch die Tochter dieses Unternehmens Melody in der Schule ihr Leben schwer. Melody ist wirklich ein toller Charakter fur Kinder, um sich mit ihr zu identifizieren. Allerdings hat sie keine Ecken und Kanten, aber fur ein Kinderbuch ist das okay. Sie hat nur einen besten Freund, aber der ist dafur mehr wert als tausend andere. Die beiden finden ein Ei und aus dem schlupft ein Greif. Das wird super suss beschrieben und man merkt die Bindung die Melody und der Greif eingehen. Schnell wird klar, dass auch der Greif in Gefahr schwebt und nun mussen die drei zusammenhalten. 
 Das ganze wird fur Kinder recht spannend, aber doch eher gefuhlsbetont, beschrieben. Allerdings ist es kein All-Age-Buch. Dafur wird alles zu leicht aufgelost und ist zu einfach strukturiert. Allerdings wird auch nirgends behauptet es sein ein All-Age-Buch und daher ist das vollig in Ordnung. Es gibt keine zu brutalen Szenen, also vollig in Ordnung fur ein Kinderbuch. 
 Das Cover stellt eine Szene aus dem Buch dar und ist daher wirklich gut gewahlt. Ich finde, dass sogar die tiefe Verbindung zwischen Melody und Agravain darauf perfekt zur Geltung kommt. Helge Vogt hat mich mit dieser Zeichnung so beeindruckt, dass ich uberlege mir doch die gedruckten Bucher der Reihe zuzulegen. 
 Der Horbuchsprecher Stefan Kaminsky ist ja eh einer der besten und auch hier machte er seine Arbeit wieder unglaublich gut. Seine Stimme passte perfekt. Man konnte die einzelnen Personen gut auseinander halten und Emotionen wurden gut vermittelt. 
 Etwas gestort hat mich, dass einige Fragen total offen blieben, ohne das es Sinn ergab. Vielleicht lag es an der Kurzung. Also ich habe keinen direkten Hinweis darauf gefunden, dass das Buch fur die Horbuchfassung gekurzt wurde, aber ich vermute es sehr stark. So wurde das Verschwinden einer Person uberhaupt nicht erklart, was ich sehr merkwurdig fand. 
 *Fazit:* 
 4,6 von 5 Sternen 
 Dies ist ein wirklich tolles Kinderbuch mit sympathischen Charakteren. Fur Kinder ist die Handlung sicher auch sehr spannend, aber vor allem konnen sie sich mit den Charakteren identifizieren. Das Buch ist kein All-Age- Buch, aber ein fantasyreiches Kinderbuch.",0,-0.662,-0.429,-0.989

181,"The History of Hilary Hambrushina is JUST your typical high school drama. 
 While there was nothing BAD about this book, there wasn't anything GOOD about it either. Following your unoriginal story about high school, this book manages to incorporate a lot of themes. You've got 'the best friend' who ends up being a traitor, the 'new girl' who ends up being awesome, the 'mean girls' who are bullies - full stop. And then you've got Hilary who is a mess 'and figuring' herself out. 
 This book ISN'T something fabulous, something you enjoy and love to bits, it's a book that teaches you about friendship, accepting yourself, overcoming obstacles, and standing up for who you really are. That's definitely an enjoyable element to the book, that the characters do funny things but all together are just a REALLY and SUPER boring cast. Kallie is the only one with a little 'sustenance' to her and I ended up liking her quite a bit. Hilary is a little 'fat' (though I think that was subjective) and I feel like her accepting herself is also quite an interesting part of the story. 
 The writing style is very basic and MG-ish. Sure I smiled at some points, but the writing definitely fitted the story line. A simple story line and simple writing. It was an easy read, nothing too dense and complicated, and I finished it relatively quickly. The pace was okay, and if you're looking for a breezy book on a summer's day, this book could be perfect for that. The only problem with the writing style is that it doesn't allow you to get engaged with the story, it feels like you are an outsider, and everything seems a bit dull. 
 The plot is basically just 'happiness over popularity, 'it's okay to be who you are' and all that other self-acceptance stuff. I feel it's important to represent different people but here I feel like any reader is too mature to read this. It deals with many issues but I just don't feel I related to any of it. Maybe younger readers would be interested in the drama about this new teenage life but I certainly wasn't. 
 All in all, Marnie Lamb tried to create something about self-love and overcoming the problems of school and such, and I think that was wonderful. The way this was executed, with a boring writing style, a typical story line and half-fleshed out characters just DIDN'T allow the reader to be captured. Don't get me wrong, the themes were great, but it was too typical and boring. These types of books are getting repetitive now and I feel it needs to be shaken up a little.",1,-0.007,0.244,0.998

183,"In this dull and meandering sequel to the excellent Anne of Green Gables, Anne spends two years (ages 16-18) living at home at Green Gables and teaching at the Avonlea school. It's just sort of a collection of events that happen. (I guess AoGG is, too, but their order is important for character development - of which there is very little in this book.) Certainly there's nothing here trascendent enough to justify the enormous suspension of disbelief that some of the events require. 
 The worst things (spoiler-cut for spoilers and also foul language): 
 * Davy and goddamn Dora. The moment their names were mentioned I groaned. They are Cousin Olivers, obv; they serve no purpose in a book which could easily have focused on children anyway (Anne's pupils); but beyond that they just don't make SENSE. Why, WHY, would ANNE AND MARILLA be the ones to take these children?! I know Marilla has a deeply felt sense of duty, but surely someone else could have been found at about the same level of distance from the mother (Marilla's third cousin) whose household has more expendable resources, or at least parent-age adults. We are talking, here, about a woman who must be about 70 and nearly blind, and a 16-year-old in her first year of an emotionally demanding full-time adult job. Not to mention, the whole reason Anne stayed home to teach was because Marilla didn't feel she could manage on her own, financially or health-wise - and that was when it was just a child-free house and farm to manage. If Marilla had any extra energy, money, or time to spare, Anne would have gone to college. Nothing appears to have changed since that decision. Under these circumstances, how can she and Anne possibly justify taking on the care of six-year-old twins??! Cats, maybe, but not children. 
 * With that said, I am not sure who is taking care of these kids really, because it seems like Anne and Marilla pretty much go about their day as if they don't exist/can be left home alone with no problem. Anne works full time, goes visiting, starts a town beautification club, studies, and pretty much never seems to be overwhelmed or strapped for time. Half the time when she gets home, Marilla has dashed down the street to Mrs Lynde's or gone on errands or something. The twins might as well be cats. (Hey, that would make a lot more sense. Maybe Anne's imagination is so vivid that all those conversations with Davy are just her impression of what such a mischievous cat would be like as a human child?) 
 * Wouldn't six-year-olds whose mom just died be, you know, sad? (Again, taken care of by ""they are cats"" theory.) 
 * I think Davy is supposed to resemble Anne in that he is mischievous, but (a) Anne wasn't really mischievous so much as forgetful with poor judgment but overall good intentions, and (b) Davy isn't so much mischievous as actually malevolent. He legit tries to hurt his sister on numerous occasions. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE 
 * One final thing about the twins: Why even bother writing them to be twins?! Dora is a complete non-character. She is supposed to be the ""good child"" opposite to Davy, I suppose, but she is so silent, docile, and emotionless that I am completely creeped out by her and feel like she must be secretly plotting to burn it all down. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT CHILD. 
 But also, dude, L.M., you made this whole thing up, if you didn't want to write a ""good girl"" twin, you didn't have to! The twins concept adds nothing and in fact the situation would be marginally less insane if Davy were a lone individual child. I can almost, ALMOST see Anne and Marilla feeling that they can take in one child temporarily howmuchtroublecanhebe (cue laugh track). 
 The fact that Anne and Marilla keep talking about they love Davy more is icing on the cake. Maybe try to actually talk to Dora? Maybe give her 1/2 of 1% of the attention you are giving to Davy, and gave to Anne? She's not a squeaky wheel but I do not think she is doing okay. 
 * New topic: Paul Irving. Paul fucking Irving. He's supposed to be Anne 2.0 but, lacking any of her faults, he just comes off as an implausible fairy-boy NOT TO MENTION kind of a smarmy ass. Like, when Anne talks about the stars being God's daisy chain or whatever, you can forgive her sounding dopey because you know it's genuine cup-runneth-over joie de vivre + lack of impulse control. Paul is much more composed and so his Musings come off as more self-consciously twee and self-satisfied. I want to smack that ""you know, teacher"" right off his smug face. 
 * Oh, and ""my little mother"" DON'T GET ME STARTED 
 * I'm with Levi Boulter, the Avonlea Village Improvement Society sounds like a bunch of jerks 
 * The storm had a lot of buildup but didn't actually have any impact on the plot 
 * The closest we get to a climax is the reunion of Stephen Irving and Lavendar Lewis, but it happens offscreen and doesn't even involve any of the characters except indirectly. In some ways I feel like it's appropriate thematically for this almost dreamlike interlude in Anne's life to have a sense of fairy-tale wonder (especially when the events can also be prosaically explained, as Marilla delightfully does), and that house sounds fucking boss. But is it too much to ask to finish on something that actually involves Anne as a principal character? She has some good character moments early on when she realizes that some of her teaching ideals are unrealistic in the face of actual children, but as the book goes on, this mostly falls by the wayside for side plots involving new characters we don't care about. 
 * Overall this book just feels more... I don't know... obvious than Green Gables. Like it's fan fiction for itself, or something. Green Gables was sentimental, but it wasn't sappy; the character development was consistent and gradual; the characters felt grounded and likeable. In this book the new characters just feel like devices, like concepts instead of people; and the old characters don't fully feel like themselves. The emotional moments rang false for me - they felt unearned due to either lack of tension/buildup or just lack of caring about the characters involved. All around, a snooze, made the more disappointing because I know how good L.M. Montgomery can be, and because there are occasional flashes of the brilliance: in the vivid way she describes things and the nature appreciation and a few of the events. She's still her, she just got the formula all wrong in this one.

191,"This book is heavy with beautiful, rich, intriguing illustrations and light on Biblical content. 
 There is no mention of God, the evil of men that caused the flood, Noah's sacrifice after leaving the ark, or God's promise to never flood the earth again (though there is a rainbow in the last illustration, it is not explained). 
 Though some ideas fall under artistic/ creative license, like the theory that men and animals on the ark slept more than normal (God could have made this happen to keep everyone sane), further inaccuracies that clearly contradict the Biblical text include: rain starting before the ark is loaded, a crowded ark, the presence of Noah's granddaughter (or any children for that matter) on the ark, the prevalence of mountains in the landscape (they are not covered by the flood waters), the inhabitants on the ark for only 40 days and nights, and (laughable) Noah ""steers the ark to land"". 
 This book was recommended by Tapestry of Grace as a contrast text. The assigned exercise included reading ""The True Story of Noah's Ark"" by Dooley, then this book, and finally the Biblical text, while recording our answers to the same 8ish questions was helpful in reminding us all that the Bible is the authority on what happened in the flood. 
 If you were going to buy one book on the Flood, this is NOT it. My student was even a bit confused by how far from the mark it is.

 Esta no es una de ellas. 
 En primer lugar me ha confundido la traduccion bastante ambigua del titulo original. ?Por que suprimir la connotacion negativa? Aun asi ninguno de los titulos me ha parecido acertado. 
 ""La de cosas aburridas y sin sentido alguno que le pasan a Barnaby Brocket"" seria un titulo mas adecuado. Nunca me habia encontrado con un acercamiento mas vulgar al concepto de ""ser normal"" o ""ser diferente"" al resto de personas que el que ha intentando llevar a cabo aqui John Boyne. 
 Barnaby se comporta como un nino de 8 anos... a veces. Otras veces no. El autor nos explica, en ocasiones, que metodos utiliza Barnaby para mantenerse pegado al suelo. En otras no. 
 El argumento no es lo unico que falla en este libro: los dialogos, desprovistos de sentido y vacios, se hacen cansinos a la decima pagina. Los personajes vienen, van y tu te preguntas una vez mas si en algun momento empezara a importante algo o alguien en esta historia. 
 Considere mucha veces dejar este libro. Incluso he empezado y acabado otros al tiempo que retomaba este, muy de vez en cuando, esperando que el final compensara todo el tiempo perdido.

 I saw the cover and read in insert and thought it would be a perfect fit for my aesthetics. However, I was very disappointed with this book. 
 I am truly amazed this book managed to slide off of an editors desk. 
 It is in serious need of editing. Not small edits. BIG edits. 
 The most unpleasant thing about this book is it's narration. It is all tell and no show. Chapters go by with the author telling you what happens and very little interaction or dialogue is present, making it very difficult to connect with the characters or the stories. Then we have the overwhealming amoung of long, descriptive sentences that slow down the pacing. Additionally, the main two characters have little character growth. The book was far too long and needed to be shortened. The author could have said the same thing in much less words and it would have made for a stronger book. 
 Reading this book was so tedious, that I was unable to finish it. It didn't hold my attention and didn't move. My eyes continued to glaze over the endless blocks of narration. It became too much. It just wasn't enjoyable. So only a few chapters shy of the ending, I set it aside and said farewell.

 ""'Believe it or not, Snow White, I had my own life before I came into yours'. 
 Snow White drew quiet and slightly ashamed. (pg.8)"" 
 Now, if that didn't raise any, 'why does she have to feel ashamed here for', great, you are much more balanced than I am. The problem is, instances of this ""tone"" creep up all over the place for me. The ones that really stick out are... 
 Where the children apologize and wonder what the ""policically correct"" thing is to call a talking frog. 
 The completely incompetent, holy-then thou teacher. 
 The father starting out a conversation where his son is distraught that he isn't as smart as his sister by telling him he'll find that women in his life will always be smarter. 
 And have I mentioned the teacher? Because not only is she pretentious and horrible (yes, tell the traumatized boy to act more like his sister. That'll help), she obviously hasn't studied fairy tales that well. Now this setup is mostly to subvert the stupid teacher later, but she's just written in such a way that I want to give the book to my rabbit so he can eat the rest of it. 
 Fairy tales, at least the Brother Grimm ones, were stories compiled by the Borther's Grimm and then watered down to be more palatable for parents to read to their children. I mean, everyone sorta knows by now Red Riding Hood isn't just about staying to ""the path"", in many earlier versions it was tinted to also include and allude to more sexual moral stories of ""staying on the path"". 
 Honestly, some of the lessons might actually seem outdated to us. Some are in need of revision to fit what we understand now. Which brings us to the ultimate pet peeve. Revisions aren't all shallow. Some are, yes, but others are interesting subversion or re-imaginings that bring to life the original message in a way more meaningful to a modern audience. 
 Obviously this book knows that because it is a revision, but as I said. A lot of this content I could see working in another book, written in a way that didn't sound like I was being condescended to. There's early hints that the teacher was being too rigid in her thinking. Goldie Locks being a fugitive for breaking and entering and thievery is one. But I don't see the tone of the book shifting. The little facts that undermine what was setup (that you have to read a story with just the prescribed meanings behind) will be presented in that same irritating way that has me wanting to smash rocks. 
 So, all done. Can't do anything about a persons writing style. Hell, to most it probably doesn't read this way, and that's wonderful. But I'm done. No more extreme irritation for me :)",1,-0.212,-0.174,-0.709

 I read this book to my son, Zachery. Now, maybe five is a bit young to be interested in a Goosebumps book. But, he was really excited before we started this book. This is the second chapter book I read to him and the first one was aimed for kids a bit younger as it had pictures (Trolls, Go Home!). But, I thought we'd give this one a try. He loves scary stuff, and of course monsters... and blood because he is a little boy after all. Plus, I LOVED Goosebumps books back in the 90s when I was a kid. He also enjoys watching the Goosebumps television show repeats that come on. So, my conclusion was that he should enjoy this book. 
 Now, I never read this one when I was a kid. Monster blood wasn't really my thing. However, this does seem to be one of the more popular titles in the series since there's several books based off of this one. Well, it turns out this could barely hold mine or my son's interest. The characters were bratty and not very likable. The story was VERY slow to start... and end. In fact, nothing really happened that was exciting until the last few chapters. Which was the biggest problem, I think. It honestly was just very boring. The ending was really strange and a bit dark. We have a few more Goosebumps books that we're going to try in the future.

266,"Flora and her family are school mice - meaning that they live in a school. But Flora is concerned that they are not taking full advantage of the opportunities that a school has to offer. She determines that she will become the world's very first educated mouse! 
 It won't be easy. And she must be very careful to make sure that she is not seen. But can a mouse really learn to read? And when Flora reads that the tasty little pellets being scattered throughout the school are 'POISON', can Flora convince her family that there is something to reading, after all? 
 Cautions. 
 Purposefully or not, The School Mice was feministic through and through. This theme is displayed most fully in the relationship between Flora's mother, Hyacinth, and father, Robin. Hyacinth is a hard-working, dictatorial, snarky wife, while Robin is an idiotic, incompetent husband who shirks responsibility whenever he can. This scene occurs just after Hyacinth has had a litter of mousekins. 
 It is obvious from the very beginning of the story that Hyacinth is the leader of the family. She makes all of the decisions and orders Robin about. He sometimes voices very feeble objections which she quickly shuts down. 
 And Flora is a true daughter of her mother. After Hyacinth moves her family out of the school, Flora stays behind to continue her education. She soon finds a boyfriend who, though less stupid than Robin, is every bit as nonassertive. Flora bosses him around just as she has watched her mother boss Robin around. 
 Apart from the problem of feminism was the problem of boy/girl relationships. When Flora finds Buck, her boyfriend, they move in together. At the end, we find out that Flora and Buck are expecting - as far as we know, they are not married. 
 Now, some may think that I'm making a big deal over nothing. After all, they're just mice, right? Who cares what mice do? The fact is, though, that whether a story's characters be people, mice, or robots, their actions demonstrate or enforce the author's own particular view of reality. The fact that it is a group of mice who are here acting improperly is irrelevant. They are the characters, the models that have been put forth for us to laugh at, admire, and emulate. 
 Conclusion. I did not find The School Mouse to be wholesome reading material for children due to its destructive lifestyle themes.

He's picked on by other kids and has a pretty pathetic life... until he falls inside the dryer while looking for a match to the weird sock he found, and finds himself in a land of ogres. 
 I kept waiting for this story to interest me, and it never did (and nearly stopped reading it several times). Granted, I'm not the target age group (which is probably around 8-11 years old), but I generally enjoy a clever and cute middle grade story. This one just never hooked me.

 Throughout the entire series,we see Nikki fight with Mackenzie over and over again.

 Mackenzie is bad and Nikki is good.All while Brandon likes Nikki and not Mackenzie.Could this get anymore cliche?I was excited for this book because I wanted to know how it would be like for Nikki to finally be rid of Mackenzie.As it turns out,Mackenzie is back! (Surprise I guess?) And not only that,the author had to go the extra mile and add in the ironic plot line that Mackenzie isn't popular at her new school.I mean seriously?

 4. On page 31 there's a drawing with the cutest skeleton EVER! looks like a shy skeleton! =D *I'll scan and upload it ASAP* 
 5. All over the books I doodled facesthat look very much like Harry Potter! *oh wait by that time the movies were out and I was a big fan already* *I'll try to scan an upload this page too*

274,"This started out a 3 star read. Things were a little too soap operish at the beginning but I figured just go with it. 
 At times we get the same storyline told from first Eli then Seth's pov, but with no indication to let us know. 
 The drama is far to quick to happen, typical use of mis understandings and jumping to conclusions not just once or twice but through out the entire story. 
 Then it dropped to a 2 star. Far to much sex in the midst of grieving for me. I can go along with needing the comfort during grieving but having sex at the funeral? Nope not buying that. Not to mention that Eli seemed to be permanently horny just at the sight of Seth, regardless of the situation/place they were in. 
 The two best friends were used to promote mis understanings and cause more drama of the soapish kind, but apart from that I never saw them actually be a best friend. 
 But then it uses one of my biggest pet peeves and drops another star. Seriously you have fallen off a roof, cracked your ribs and have a concussion that has you throwing up and seeing double. You even pass out after a kiss. So on coming round what do you do? You Strain, Convulse and Writhe while getting a hand job. Seriously? Still at least after ""the euphoric buzz helping to ease the shock waves of pain in his back and ribs to a dull roar."" Sorry but sex after such a serious injury is a real killer for me. 
 Another niggle for me was when Eli assures Seth he is clean because "" he'd never gone bareback with anyone"" and yet at the end we get told ""Eli realized he hadn't used a condom with Bethany"" 
 So basically Eli there's no telling what you might have, that's assuming Bethany was the only time you forgot the condom with. 
 As a whole this had a great idea. Take out the immediate thoughts of sex while supposedly grieving. Tone down the soap land drama a little and skip the whole best friends try to spoil things parts altogether and you might just have a shorter story that's worth reading.

 Told from the perspective of one schoolboy, who happens to tell another pupil that a third classmate has a peanut allergy, the book has all the excitement of stale bread. 
 What I suppose is supposed to hook us is the fact it's told with a medley of poetic methods: haiku, limerick, freeform, shape, you name it. But no acrostics. 
 Technically, a lot could no doubt be gleaned from some literary analysis is the classroom. But it breaks the golden rule of children's literature: if it's totally boring, nobody really cares why it's boring in rhyming couplets.

 Existen dos adaptaciones muy famosas de este libro, las cuales son la version animada de Disney y la version actuada de Tim Burton. 
 La pelicula animada nunca la he visto completa. Nunca me ha convencido. 
 La version de Tim Burton (a pesar de ser de Tim Burton) tampoco me gusto. 
 Si bien se sabe, en 9 de cada 10 casos el libro es mejor que la pelicula. Este libro entra en el caso sobrante donde sucede lo contrario.

 Este es un libro de 100 paginas el cual me tarde casi dos semanas en leer... !100 PAGINAS! !EN DOS SEMANAS! Los capitulos eran de menos de 10 paginas y solamente podia soportar leer esta pequena dosis por dia. Era demasiado para mi. 
 Creo que Lewis C. es un buen escritor, y la verdad es que la historia es muy peculiar y original. Pero simplemente a mi no me gusto. 
 No encontraba sentido en la trama, me confundia al punto de irritarme y Alicia se ha convertido en uno de los personajes que mas aborrecere en el mundo de la literatura. 
 Este libro casi me causa un bloqueo de lector. Considere en dejar este libro cuando ya llevaba mas o menos 20 paginas leidas. Siendo honestos, la unica razon por la que lo termine es por su tamano.

Readers will even learn how fast light can travel: from the moon to the Earth in less than three seconds! Veteran science author Franklyn M. Branley's lively text and Stacey Schuett's new illustrations combine fun facts and hands-on activities in this accessible introduction to the science of light."" 
 My Review: This book came in a box of used books and it seemed like an interesting book with great learning opportunities. Unfortunately this book took it way to far and became too technical and scientific for the audience. It would have been good if it had just focused on one concept dealing with light (ie. reflection) but it went into detail of many forms of light. Munchkin is a little advanced and often enjoys non-fiction books but this one was long and confusing for him, it is definitely not a book for someone reading picture books.",1,0.265,0.739,0.98

332,"In certain ways, Here Comes the Shaggedy is a throwback to the earliest Goosebumps books. It's written in third-person, a mode that became increasingly rare as R.L. Stine figured out the style of the series. The chapters are also unusually long for a Goosebumps book of the 2010s. Welcome to Dead House, Monster Blood, and others from the original series featured lengthy chapters, but they became shorter as R.L. Stine found his rhythm and audience. A few Goosebumps classics have been set in and around mysterious swamps, and Here Comes the Shaggedy revisits that environment with the story of Kelli and her younger brother Shawn, city kids dragged to backwoods Florida for a year so their father can study marine life in the swamp. They aren't pleased with the move in the first place, but they go from unhappy to terrified when they learn that something horrible is lurking in the brackish water. 
 Kelli promises her father she'll give Florida a chance, but Florida seems in no hurry to reciprocate. Zeke and Decker, twins from the one-room school that Kelli and Shawn are enrolled in, ridicule the two new city kids, and tell disturbing tales about a monster of the swamp. The Shaggedy is ruthless, they say, attacking people and destroying property indiscriminately. Shawn, a naturally fearful soul, begs his father to go home to New York. Kelli isn't convinced there's any swamp monster, but something bizarre is going on. Monstrous footprints appear outside their house, and Kelli catches a creepy old man who goes by the name Ranger Saul sneaking in the vicinity. Whatever embellishments Zeke and Decker have added to the legend, the Shaggedy is real, Ranger Saul insists, a threat to everyone living near the swamp. Can Kelli decipher the truth before her family and neighbors are consumed by a grotesque primordial beast...if the Shaggedy exists at all? 
 Here Comes the Shaggedy is slower paced than most Goosebumps books, and doesn't entirely make sense, but there are a few positives to it. The story feels different than much of what R.L. Stine writes, and Shawn is an appealing character. It's easy for us to feel protective of him, especially when he's in real danger. My favorite Goosebumps character is still Billy Deep, but I like Shawn. I'll give Here Comes the Shaggedy one and a half stars, and if you enjoyed the first few installments in the Most Wanted sub-series, you'll probably be a fan of this book.",1,-0.354,-0.333,-0.982

334,"This book won the Children's Book Council of Australia Picture Book of the Year in 1980. Frankly that was before Graeme Base came along and blew out of the water this rather paltry effort at creating intricate illustrations to match an alphabet or counting book. 
 The book starts in ""the real world"" were a Dragon goes to bed with a cat and a rather large cutlass... then the ""way-out-there"" fantasy dream starts... So I dislike the premise and set-up of the book. The dream sequence was more an actual dream sequence than a dream in a story. Everything is disjointed, there doesn't seem to be any cause-and-affect and everything is bizarre - which doesn't make for a good narrative. 
 The novelty of this book was to make it a puzzle book (as perfected by Graeme Base). Within each counting page there are an matching number of a variety of different objects. Greame Base does this well because the objects pictured blend in the scene... Peter Pavey's method is to simply dump whatever happens to be in his head at the time - Why are there 10 lemons the size of garbage bins scattered around the street, 7 wells within 20 meters, 6 discarded seashells in a courtroom??? Noone knows... but remember it's just a dream sequence so we can do whatever we want...",1,-0.117,0.273,0.864

 So I figured A would like this book as she is three. She really as not very interested in it, as it didn't seem to hold her attention she was asking for another book to be read after this one. 
 This is a very simple book there wasn't much detail with the pictures so I am sure that is why A didn't enjoy it. 
 You have a young boy who is visiting his bear friend they really don't do much other than eat and watch TV. I think the pictures could have used a bit more brightening up. There is really no dialogue between the two main characters as the little boy just describes what they are doing and what not.

351,"This is a sweet book about a young girl learning to step out of the box she was born into. Winnie is the daughter of the wealthiest family in town and her family is very overprotective. She lives next to a wood which is owned by her family but is never allowed to leave the protection of the yard. When she finally gets up the courage to break the rule and goes out of the yard to chase what she thinks might be fairy music, she opens her world to much much more. 
 This book was written for the 8-10 crowd so definitely there wasn't enough plot or character depth to keep me interested, but it was appropriate for the age group. What I DIDN'T feel was appropriate for the age group was the interaction between Jessie and Winnie. Jessie is a man who has decades of experience, in the body of a 17 year old. Winnie is a 10 year old girl who has led a sheltered life. Yet Jessie asks Winnie to drink the water when she gets a couple of years older so they can get married and live happily ever after forever.

352,"Mallory has applied to Riverbend, a boarding school in rural Massachusetts, after becoming increasingly alienated at Stoneybrook Middle School due to bullying (Kristy in Charge). She is accepted on a full scholarship for promising young writers, and she accepts. Jessi is angry, feeling that Mallory is abandoning her, and that she is running away from her problems rather than facing them. Mallory insists that she is not running from something so much as she running to something great, and she has to follow her dreams. Note that I have not mentioned Mary Anne yet. Despite Mary Anne's narrator status, she does basically nothing except watch this train wreck. 
 Mallory and Jessi each complain about each other to Mary Anne. After a few failed attempts to get them to work it out by co-assigning them BSC jobs and inviting Mallory to Jessi's party, Mary Anne finally brings them both over to her house and forces them to have it out with each other, acting as mediator. 
 In the kid-oriented subplots, Jessi encourages the Pike siblings' feelings that Mallory is abandoning them, and Kristy and the others organize a holiday party for the residents of the nursing home Stoneybrook Manor. 
 Lingering Questions: 1. The question that leaps out on every page of this book is: Why is this is a Mary Anne book? I see why this isn't Mallory's book--she's going to narrate the next one, in which she starts Riverbend, and you can't have the same person narrate two books in a row--but why not Jessi? She hasn't had a book since #115 (Jessi's Big Break), and she won't get another before the end of the series. Mary Anne, meanwhile, will get the final book, The Fire at Mary Anne's House, just six books from now. 
 I understand that Mary Anne is a good listener, so if you're going to deal with this dispute from the perspective of an outsider, she's a logical choice, but this book says absolutely nothing about Mary Anne or her arc. There's a little of her feeling awkward about her position in the middle, and she reacts to everything that happens, but overall her feelings about the proceedings are no more acute or unusual than anyone else's. I like her being the catalyst of the girls' make-up, but that could have happened in a Mallory or a Jessi book. I can't tell if the complete focus on Mallory and Jessi over Mary Anne is laziness (the writer didn't bother giving Mary Anne much to do) or realistic (a truly other-focused good listener would see the situation as being all about X or Y, and not herself). Maybe it would have been interesting if the author had run with Mary Anne's other-focused-ness and made it turn from a book about two other people to a book about Mary Anne's inability to deal with her own life when her friends are in a crisis, or her overbearing attempts to make everyone get along even when her interventions makes the problem worse? But it doesn't really go there. 
 2. Why is Jessi so unsympathetic when she just went through the exact same thing? I read this book right after Jessi's Big Break, so the about-face in Jessi's feelings about leaving town to live your dreams was particularly jarring. Jessi's month in New York is referenced several times in this text, including a scene where Jessi's NYC friends come to Stoneybrook for a party and show sympathy for Mallory's situation (to Jessi's dismay). I'm glad the author remembers that this happened, but it seems weird that Jessi is so dead-set against Mallory leaving to pursue her dreams/career when not only was Jessi tempted to do the same just a few books ago, but she didn't even seem to care that much that (1) Mallory wasn't around and (2) Mallory was back home, missing her. Jessi insists that Mallory's departure is ""different"", but she doesn't give reasons why. I feel like there are a couple of missing steps here. 
 Let's try to draw them. Jessi didn't miss Mallory when she was away. Conclusion: she assumes Mallory won't miss her. Out of sight, out of mind, except when you're the one back home, bored, and constantly reminded of the things you used to do together. Also: Jessi ultimately chose not to go away to school. Why not? That's something else that wasn't explained to my satisfaction, I surmised in my review for #115 that it was partly guilt. She wanted to go, but she felt guilty about how much her family/friends had missed her (and how little she missed them), and she decided she had responsibilities at home and ought to put off her dreams for awhile. Mallory isn't making that choice. Jessi resents Mallory because she gets what Jessi wanted, and because her own guilt is not enough to stop her--therefore, she seems to love Jessi less than Jessi loves her. 
 It would have been nice if any of this was in the book. 
 3. Why are the eleven-year-olds always the ones to get the career breaks? 
 Weird BSC Rules: Mallory laments her lack of a place at home--school problems, getting lost in the shuffle of eight kids, an unimportant role even in the BSC. ""I won't be thirteen for two more years [ed. note: ha!]. Until then I'll be a junior officer."" But the original four started the BSC when they were 12, and they had their offices right from book #1. If thirteen is the official BSC start age for officership, it's certainly a hypocritical and ret-conny policy (and I wouldn't be surprised if they changed it every year to their current age). 
 In a similar weird oversight of the existence of twelve-year-olds, Kristy decides not to hire a replacement for Mallory because the eighth grade at SMS is tapped out and they can't think of any sixth-graders as mature as Mallory and Jessi. Leaving aside the two other middle schools in Stoneybrook, why doesn't Claudia nominate some of her seventh-grade friends? 
 Adult Watch: Mrs. Pike has a full-time temp job as a salesperson at Bellair's for the holiday rush. Her friend Maureen McGill must have gotten her the job. 
 Timing: December. Mallory is going to start her new school in the spring semester. The book ends before the holidays, but goes far enough into December to include a pre-Christmas holiday party. Riverbend sure doesn't mind about last-minute decisions, huh? 
 Revised Timeline: Riverbend is just 100% college (the next book will remove all doubt). In an ideal world, this plot development would have happened when my revised timeline indicated that Mallory was a rising college freshman, but we missed that signpost a long time ago. She's still in college by my revised timeline, but she's in her senior year, so it seems weird to be transferring for just one semester. Maybe she is actually graduating early and going directly into a geographically distant postgrad program. Jessi doesn't have a leg to stand on expecting them to stay together much longer, though, especially since she's almost certainly moving to NYC after graduation, and Mallory stated in #115 that she could never live there.",2,-0.377,-0.079,0.991

 I remember reading a book containing a series of stories about the Dreamtime and the Rainbow Serpent as a child, then when I was a little older reading My Place by Sally Morgan. I was reminded of this on a recent trip to Central Australia, but despite these early introductions I was shocked at the level of my ignorance of the culture of indigenous australians. To assist in breaking down this ignorance, both for me and X-man (as he grows up), I decided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's stories would be part of his life from a young age. This is relatively easy these days with the availability of large numbers of indigenous stories, by indigenous authors and illustrators. Also check out Australian Museum Indigenous Australia site which contains 20 creation stories from around Australia - available as text, audio, or video. 
 So this is the first one! 
 Given there is no description what is is about? 
 This is a story from the Wongutha people from the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia (around Kalgoorlie) about how a constellation of stars (the Seven Sisters) came to have its current configuration. The Seven Sisters come down to earth in human form, and get stalked by some male Yayarrs (small men who could also travel to the stars) looking for wives. Eventually one Yayarr male singles out one of the sisters as she drinks from a creek. He chases her, briefly captures her, attempts to beat her with a stick, and eventually she escapes. She returns to the hill where they had landed on earth only to discover her 6 other sisters had already returned to the sky. This is why the Seven Sisters constellation consists of a group of 6 stars, and one star trailing behind. 
 Firstly a warning - this book was designed for a much older audience than X-man, so I can't really judge it for its primary audience. 
 The story itself seemed a little violent for our modern (maybe over-protective) sensibilities. A pack of men stalking some young women trying to make them 'their wives'. Waiting for one sister to leave the group, then chasing her (""ran like she'd never run before"" ... ""Her heart thumped loudly and she gasped for breath. She knew she had to escape."") then roughly grabbing her and attempting to beat her with a ""big stick"". Finally she escapes. 
 The story really doesn't end happily. The story ends with the sister realising her sisters had left her on earth and her response: ""Trembling and shaking all over the woman cried ... (I'm alone. What will I do?). The woman cried and cried for a long time"". 
 I suppose it was told as a cautionary tale about why it is critical to stay with the group... 'Stay with your dad as we go through the shopping centre or you will end up like the seventh sister...'. But in all I thought it was a little violent and sad (maybe I'll be happier with this as X-man gets older?)",2,-0.557,-0.226,-0.987

 I don't remember much from this for I read this during middle school.

And I get excited and had high expectations- because I trust her opinion. 
 But I may had a tad bit higher expectations than I should. 
 And the book flunked for me. Like there were so many bits and pieces I enjoyed, especially with the totally weird characters and that creepy cool cover. But then the freakin' mystery! The freakin' conclusion?!? 
 It made no sense! Like how?? What?? I mean all this build up and hype and crap- and then that. What a let down. I still feel disappointed.

We have a protective older sister, but she's a fencer, a sportsperson, a fierce whirlwind. And we have faeries, but they're not nice. The illustrations are also very attractive and complement the material beautifully. However, the storyline felt like it was lacking a LOT to me--there's very little substance to it, very little meat. Mysteries are usually intriguing because they pull you in, and in this I really did feel like a camera was just following people around while they did things.

 I had high hopes for Say Cheese, Medusa! but unfortunately it just didn't work out. McMullan had the bones of a good retelling: the myth from the beginning of Medusa's curse to the end of Perseus's adventure; some humor, and some creative updating. But the updating got way-out of hand and gimmicky and the story was completely overwhelmed. 
 Poseidon and Zeus are portrayed as irresponsible party boys who follow the obnoxious frat boy stereotype. McMullan has replaced numbers with Roman numerals, clever the first time but quickly becomes boring. There are a lot of characters and everybody has nicknames and I think this would make it a little difficult for younger readers who aren't as familiar with the myth to keep up. The mix of old and new like Necta-Cola and Kamara instead of camera never quite flowed right, and the SNIT (the Sea Nymph Intelligence Team) was too silly to be appreciated. The whole story just became obnoxious and overwhelming. 
 Verdict: 
 Say Cheese, Medusa! could have been a fun modernized retelling of the Medusa myth, but it was overwhelmed with gimmicks. If you know a young reader who enjoys myths they might enjoy this book but it's not the first book that I would recommend.

However, the book has not lived up to my hopes. 
 I've been trying to read these aloud today with the plan of reading them with the young kids later, but I'm finding it impossible. While I enjoy the subject matter, and can see how it appeals to a lot of kids, the poetry is almost without rhythm - or at least if there is any, I have yet to find it. With all the different writers that I teach, I'm used to having to read pieces many times to get a feel for the way it should sound (particularly with Duffy, Cummings and Gluck), but I found only two or three poems in this entire book that I would be able to read aloud even after a lot of practice. To me, they don't seem to have any structure whatsoever - they're just puddles of words.

402,"Winnie's addiction to honey 
 15 November 2013 
 Well I had a look at the picture on the back of this book which has a train (being pulled by Tootle - I vaguely remember Tootle) and the train had all of these characters that appeared in the Little Golden Books (though Big Bird was a little too big for the train, so he had to walk along beside it). Anyway, the characters come from a whole range of places, including Disney, however the interesting thing that I noticed was that all of the Sesame Street characters were all noted as being owned by Muppets Inc, which I something that I probably did know, though it was most likely buried deep in my brain. Well, now it has been pulled out again, and I have also placed that relatively pointless piece of knowledge up onto the internet (as if it wasn't there already). Anyway, if you are at a trivia night, and the host asks the question 'who owns the characters from Sesame Street,' you can say 'Muppets Inc'. 
 As for this book, well, I never had much to do with Winnie the Pooh when I was a kid, and I really don't know much about his antics beyond his addiction to honey. In this book he attempts a commando style raid against a beehive to attempt to steal some honey, only to discover that the bees that live in this hive are not honey bees. I wonder if Winnie the Pooh actually has an addiction to honey because he goes to extraordinary lengths to try to get his hands on it, and will risk his life (as he does in this book) to attempt to get some. However, they don't suggest that he suffers from withdraw symptoms when he doesn't get any honey. 
 I'm not a big fan of honey myself. It is sticky and messy and really doesn't taste all that great. People sometimes ask me if I would like honey in my cup of tea because they don't have any sugar. Personally, I would rather drink the tea without any sugar than with honey because honey simply does not replace sugar. I have tried drinking tea with honey in it before any it does not taste anything like tea with sugar in it. In fact, it doesn't taste all that nice at all. However, that is just my feeling towards honey, and who am I to criticise Winnie for liking honey because he obviously loves honey and will do anything to get his hands on it. I can't think of anything that causes that reaction in me though, and that is probably a good thing.",2,0.036,0.086,0.884

 Although the writing was easy, interesting and quick for the reader there were other parts of the book that were questionable. First the characters were all colored while their clothing portrayed them as stereotypes that one would normally be faced. Although I am normally lax with allowing for those stereotypes depending upon the timeframe that the book was written it but the fact that Liza is in barely no clothing while even showing her underwear at one point was really the point that made me dislike the whole ""poor"" showing stereotypes. And furthermore two of the villains were light colored although the former did look like Critter from that same-named species.

In order to get from Biblical stories to the Chronicles of Narnia, you have to remove all the horrible details, like God commanding 'every living thing that breathes' to be killed in Jericho, and you have to add a good deal of charisma and nobility.

However, that is exactly what Abraham did to Sara, when they had to cross Egypt (he knew the pharoah would want his wife, and yet chose to go anyway. Telling Sara to lie about their marital status doesn't make Abraham a hero--it makes him a pimp). If Prince Caspian was given such a choice, he would have fought the pharoah and won, he would have gone through some horrible trials as he went around Egypt, or he wouldn't have gone at all, and the God that had commanded him to go would have learned a lesson.

 Not all of these indoctrinations are necessarily bad; in fact, some of them can be quite beneficial given the right circumstances, but in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz the presentation of these ideas is always coupled with a quite frightening lack of thought. 
 None of the characters ask questions...about anything...ever (with the exception of ""Can I have brains, a heart, courage, or go home?""). They accept things as they are, blindly agree with whatever they are told, make snap judgments about the good or evil of whomever they meet and act accordingly, and their answer to every antagonistic situation is to kill. Dorothy kills, the Lion kills, the Tin Woodman kills, even the Scarecrow kills, and there is never a hint of regret or guilt from any of them -- even mister big heart in the hollow body. They want what they want, and if they have to kill to get it then so be it. 
 I have been reading some Wonderful Wizard of Oz criticism as I've been reading the book, and many critics see Baum's opening book as a political and social satire. I tried hard to see it, I wanted to see it, but what I saw was a book that sells familiar myths to people who want the familiar. It is a myth of ""goodness,"" a myth of class distinction, a myth of meritocracy, a myth of ""evil,"" and worst of all a myth of benevolent and righteous violence. 
 Yet, for all its problems, it is compellingly fun to read, especially if you have occasion to read it out loud to your children and discuss the behaviour of the characters. Even if your children are young (mine are both five), they should leave The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with a touch more self-awareness and a healthier view of the big entertainment versions of Baum's story. 
 And there is, for me, one truly redeeming quality in this classic: I appreciate the genius of Gregory Maguire's Wicked all the more. I see now why China Mieville chose it as one of the 50 books all socialists must read. I've read Wicked once before, long before I read Baum, but I'll be reading it again...and soon.

452,"As a young prodigy of the world of astrophysics, You are given the option fresh out of the academy of Interstellar Exploration to embark on a mission like none other in Earth's history. The spaceship Athena has been designated for the difficult and extremely risky assignment of intentionally taking a live crew through a black hole in space, in hopes that they will make it through the spacial anomaly alive and be able to find out once and for all the mysteries surrounding the existence of black holes. 
 As one of the top students in your class (who also happened to write on your academy questionnaire that you were ""ready for anything""), You have been given first crack at this seemingly impossible mission. You also have the less risky option of going along on the companion ship Nimrod, which will attend on the trip with Athena and observe the goings-on from outside the rim of the black hole's event horizon. If Athena gets into danger, Interstellar Exploration theorizes, then Nimrod may be able to help. 
 The opportunity to go on Nimrod certainly is there to be taken, though most of the book's more exciting and longer story possibilities come as a result of intrepidly offering to join the ship bound for the heart of danger in the black hole. Even if all goes just right your chances of survival are not great, but you have the satisfaction of knowing that you're the first human being who has every attempted anything like this. 
 The ways of dying in or around the black hole are many, and you're going to need a fair helping of luck to make it through the initial experience intact. If you do make it across the divide alive, you'll find a universe as different from ours as could be, in which the most basic of physical laws are completely inverted. You'll have to navigate your way carefully in this perilous new universe, and with only a limited supply of fuel and oxygen for you and your partner on the mission. Your survival will depend on how cautiously (and wisely) you make your decisions, and on whether or not you can grasp enough about this so vastly different universe to understand what you need to change about your survival instincts in order to adapt. 
 Edward Packard clearly knows a great deal about theoretical science. He introduces some pretty radical concepts in Through the Black Hole, such as reverse gravity and the possibility of white holes being found on the other side of the black holes that we know in our universe. The scenes that have to do with walking on the inside shell of a planet that has a reverse gravity pull are also quite scientifically advanced, pushing the limits of the reader's comprehension of the realities of space and time. 
 All in all, Through the Black Hole is a good book with some intriguing little twists. I think that it's designed to spark interest in further scientific study about space, and is notably advanced in its subject matter for when it was published. In 1990, knowledge of white hole theory hadn't yet really entered mainstream cultural awareness, but Edward Packard knew how to include the idea of them in a book in ways that were both exciting and scientifically sound.

454,"I ran across this title while searching for feminist fairy tales, and while this does fit the bill, it's also kind of boring. 
 This is a fairly standard tale where in an attempt to rescue a prince(ss), a valiant prince(ss) has to carefully follow directions and also treat anyone encountered nicely. Fiona, the noble-hearted younger sister, saves fish and birds and turtles, while her beautiful but self-absorbed and mean older sister Columbine doesn't help. Of course in the end the prince falls in love wit the nice one. 
 The differences are that Fiona doesn't want to marry him - she wants to travel around the world. Which in the end, she and her father and the prince do. Hurray. But the evil sister steals some gold from them and slips away. That's it??? Frankly, I know Fiona was supposed to be the embodiment of kindness, but it stretches belief that she'd keep dragging her useless sister around while trying to break the enchantment. And why these particular tasks? Why was the prince enchanted in the first place? I'm much more interested in the details not in the story than the actual story!

 Gasp! This one very slightly deviates from the formula! An actual plot is starting to coalesce? Does it save the series? ...not really. Spoilers in the review, but if you've been reading these reviews so far, you should realize how little that can possibly matter with books like these. 
 It's hard to even say these books are ""okay"" now. The only reason this one is two stars is because the formula deviated. Maybe something brilliant will happen next book and I'll be wowed and brought back up. (Wait, did I just say next book? ...of course I did.) 
 But, so, at first we seem to have the stereotypical guardian: a woman who's so obsessed with what's ""in"" that she's not a good parental figure. (Orphans are in now, so she can take care of them.) Her husband is a better person, but he's too passive to stand up to his wife (or anyone, actually) much like in The Miserable Mill, where the guardian's business partner is very nice, but afraid to stand up to their guardian. 
 Blah, blah, blah, she's doing an auction of things that are in to make her wealthier and... the auctioneer she chooses is Count Olaf! Gasp! Surprise! 
 However, we find out that Count Olaf was her old acting coach, and so they were in cahoots the whole time. I actually really do like this... rather than having everyone be oblivious, it's actually that their guardian is actively working against them. And not just stupid. 
 Oh, and then... blah, blah, blah, Quagmire Triplets, very oblique but useless hints towards a larger plot, Mr. Poe is shocked! It's the standard ending.

 Hmm. The writing style is exactly the same as the original series, so if you're worried about this series feeling different - don't worry about it. Also don't worry that it will be told from a different perspective or focus on different characters instead of Kendra and Seth: though new family members are introduced at the beginning they aren't really a part of the book again until a short bit at the end. So that was also a relief. 
 But overall, this book felt really boring. It's just another typical quest with a laundry list of things to do that only Kendra and Seth can do, so they do it; there are no major problems they can't solve within a few minutes, and then everyone's back home at the end of the day, preserve/sanctuary/the world saved and all in its proper place. (And I mean at the end of the day - the entire quest takes them a day and a half to achieve.) Meanwhile, other preserves & sanctuaries are falling left, right, & centre, and it's just through the divine saving powers of Seth that any preserves/sanctuaries/worlds are still standing. 
 The entire premise for the plot was terrible: if Marat & Agad can't figure out why the defences at Blackwell Keep are shaky, then why didn't they go ask the 'Fair Folk' and the Somber Knight? If they couldn't go because they were dragons and they thought they wouldn't be aided, why not have Kendra and Seth be the ones to go discover such information - instead of making them caretakers of Blackwell Keep?? It just seemed like way too much of a stretch for me that all the adults in this book would have absolutely no one to turn to except two early teenaged kids. 
 Seth is off in this book. Reading through the original series, his character grows the most; by the time you finish Keys to the Demon Prison, Seth has gone through a lot of really awful stuff and lived to tell the tale. But in this book, he seems to have regressed a little: whereas in previous books he goaded centaurs and similar creatures in an attempt to get others riled up enough to actually pitch in and do their bit, in this book he's just whiny and being rude, point blank. And the scene where they meet the King of the 'Fair Folk' annoys me - just because you make your character point out that no one is giving them information and just being cryptic for no reason, doesn't mean you get away with making your characters cryptic as the author. Just give us the information we need instead of shuttling us off one department to another to get the simple bit of info we needed to save the day. 
 Seth isn't just uselessly poking at people, he's also taking much more careless risks, but those risks of course tie into the whole grand save-the-day bit at the end. Before, he was a bit ignorant of how the magical world worked, and could be justified in getting misled by satyrs, demons, whathaveyou, but now he's just off doing whatever for a bit of gold instead of actually adventuring like he used to. Grands Sorenson and blank slate Kendra still don't like anything he does or trust him to make a single intelligent decision, even after all they've been through, though now, ironically enough, he's actually acting like the brat they've been saying he was. 
 I wish Mull would let everyone grow up a bit and make good decisions together instead of relying on the same plot devices that he did in the prior series - Grandpa Sorenson either says no or would definitely say no, Seth does it anyway because he's the only character with a brain in the book, everything works out perfectly, world is saved, Grandparents and Kendra are appalled that Seth did what he did, glad that the world is saved but are still going to reprimand him for doing anything. The same plot is in motion here, only slightly changed at the end because no one actively reprimands him - instead asking Seth if he feels he needs a punishment for acting out. Geez guys. 
 The last two or three chapters are the best in the entire book. I wish the entire book had felt that exciting. It wasn't the most exciting thing ever, but it felt like something was actually happening, and I really enjoyed it. 
 And yay more inner dialogue about how hot guys are from Kendra's perspective. She's already set on her ancient unicorn - the book honest to God says Bracken is her 'one and only' - but she's ogling all the dudes and blushing over the prince in the kingdom of the fair folk. 
 Given the super-obvious mention of the Five Crowns near the beginning, I guess we should be expecting the Queen of Ogres to make an appearance at some point in this series, having been introduced to all the rest of rulers. I really wish I could look forward to that; hopefully the next instalments in this series will be a little more interesting as he gets the overarching plot more into gear. 
 I was also wondering who had taken over the position of caretaker at Living Mirage. Agad was going to be at the end of the last book in the original series, but now Agad is off to Soaring Cliffs in this book. All the Grandparents are accounted for and present at Fablehaven, the Sorenson set accompanying Kendra and Seth to Blackwell Keep, and all the other characters we know are off on other assignments. So who was set up there?

Toddlers (and even pre-toddlers) will find the bright, shining colors interesting, and the objects selected to represent each color are well-chosen and pleasantly hued. Most of the animals and objects in the book aren't one solid color; the green snake, for example, has bands of brighter green along its coiled, lighter green body, and the two-tone blue butterfly has an electric-blue inner wing area and darker blue tips. Not only is the diversity of color in the book eye-catching, it also introduces concepts of subtle shading across the color spectrum; there isn't just pink, blue, red, green or yellow, but myriad shades of each that still fit within the range of the color. 
 My favorite page in the book is probably the ""Blue"" one, with depictions of a soaring Mountain Bluebird, a pair of blue jeans (naturally!) and the luminous blue butterfly flapping beneath the word ""Blue"", surrounded by four smaller butterflies endowed with bright blue wings. The entire book's color scheme is nice, but this page in particular. Everything considered, I would give Learn Your Colors at least one and a half stars, and probably the full two.

490,"Anne of the Windy Poplars covers the three years Anne Shirley is teaching as the principal of Summerside High School. She's living away from Green Gables and, like with her time at Redmond, about to discover friends and adventures away from the familiarity of the Island. As you might recall from the previous book, Anne and Gilbert have recently become engaged. However, Gilbert is at medical school for these three years, so Anne goes off to teach. What results is a series of letters from Anne to Gilbert describing her time living in Summerside. 
 First of all, let's chat about the epistolary element. I love books which are collections of letters. Often times, I adore these books far more than I should. However, Montgomery's execution is all off. I don't think I'd mind the change in writing style if it was consistent. But we have chapters where Anne is obviously writing to Gilbert and others where it seems like our omniscient third-person narrator has jumped in again. These breaks are unclear and disrupted my reading enjoyment. I found myself stopping and asking, ""Wait, did this change? Why did this change?"" 
 I was frustrated with the incompetence and rambling nature of all the secondary characters. I felt like everyone in Summerside who did not live in or around Windy Poplars was an excessive, gossipy chatterbox! I honestly skimmed far more of this book than I have skimmed any book in years. From Aunt Mouser's ramblings about all the terrible things to happen at weddings to Miss Valentine giving Anne a graveyard tour to Minerva Tomgallon describing how everyone came to unfortunate circumstances in her cursed mansion-- I just didn't care. So many secondary characters rambled on and on about things which never really mattered or came to anything. It is frustrating. 
 The most redeeming factor is how lovely Anne Shirley still is. Because, don't get me wrong, while this might be a 2 star review, I would read it just for Anne. What I love about Anne's character in this novel is how she is challenged to meeting so many things head on. Anne Shirley might be scared, frustrated, or despondent, but she never gives up. Yes, many of these situations just magically seem to work themselves out. But that's okay! That's part of the magic of these books. The message here is around pushing yourself beyond your boundaries and comfort zones. There are some amazing and wonderful lessons in these pages. 
 In the end, I think this is a worthy addition to the Anne of Green Gables series. It is certainly not my favorite book, but it does add some depth to Anne's character and delivers some strong messages about what it means to push yourself and to be a good neighbor. Recommended to any fans of Anne of Green Gables who has not quite gotten to this book.",2,-0.05,0.116,0.979
491,"Olive has spent her life in apartments. Beige, square, comfortable apartments. But when her parents jump on a cheaply-priced and fully-furnished home, she finds herself in a place stuffed full twisted corners and other people's odds and ends. In particular, a number of paintings that conceal their own worlds. But the home also has its secrets . . . 
 The most I can say for this is that it just failed to grab me. Olive is a boring protagonist most notable for liking pink kitty cereal. Given that the main antagonist was a painter, I was expecting more out of Olive's interest in art---or her gift of crayons to Morton---but in the end none of it matters. Morton, similarly, is just there, either to annoy Olive or to enable her plans to succeed. He has a more interesting backstory and more potential, but he doesn't have a lot of agency. 
 The most interesting characters are the cats, particularly Harvey, who thinks he's various characters from classic literature and even dresses up to play the parts. I liked all the cats, though. From the overly-formal Leopold who secretly enjoys a good head scratch to the disgruntled Horatio to the probably-deranged Harvey, these are the characters who stand out. It's just a shame the book isn't really about them. 
 Also, a minor note, but one that really bugged me: Olive mentions not turning off the lights as ""the worst thing you could do,"" because of the environment. This is puzzling. The WORST thing she can do is waste a few dollars' worth of electricity? Apparently lying, cheating, stealing, killing, etc, are only sort-of bad, but leaving a light on is THE WORST. 
 Overall, other than the cats, nothing draws me to continue what is obviously a series. All the same, it isn't bad, just run-of-the-mill. I rate this book Neutral.",2,-0.357,-0.212,-0.978

 Though the message of this book is very important and one that I definitely support, I did not enjoy this book very much. At first I loved the writing style and Barnaby's story, but the more I read, the more irritated I became. The plot was repetitious (Barnaby travelled to a new place, someone helped him, these people had terrible parents, and then Barnaby helped them) and lacked subtlety more than anything. Yes, I get the message. I think even little children reading this book got the message way before reaching the page 100, not to mention page 278. 
 Barnaby needed to struggle more. Terrible things happened to him like the title says but he never had any real difficulties. Whenever he was floating in the air, someone caught him easily. He could just walk to a gallery and make a struggling artist famous. He easily saved an astronaut without any problems. And when he was imprisoned, there came a man and saved him, just liked that. Boring. I wanted to connect with him and read about his struggles. It would have been better if Boyne had edited a lot and concentrated on just some aspects of the story. I was the most interested in the family dynamics and wanted to learn more about the Brockets.

 A boy is found in the National Gallery, staring into space. He can't tell the police his name, although there is a tag on his shirt that says ""Arthur"". The diagnosis-- traumatic amnesia. He is placed with an emergency foster mother, Mary Sullivan, who has a daughter Art's age, Camille. The two get along well, and during an outing to the museums, Art starts to pick up on some clues about who he is. Unfortunately, these get him followed and result in some high speed chases, fire alarms being pulled, and violence to Christmas trees. Art and Camille end up at one of the places from Art's past, and he starts to remember why he was traumatized. There's a much bigger issue at stake dealing with some Van Gogh paintings. Can the two children stay safe and shed some light on international art forgery? 
 Strengths: I really liked Mary and Camille, and thought that most of the police were very sympathetic and helpful while observing protocol. When one neglected protocol, it wasn't a good idea! The descriptions of D.C. and the museums were very interesting, especially since I was just there. Art's amnesia made sense, and the mystery worked out well. Lots of details about art. 
 Weaknesses: There's pretty much zero interest in art related mysteries in my library. Blue Balliet? Gathering dust. Malone's The Sixty-Eight Rooms? Not going out, even though I love it. The one exception is Ponti's Framed, but that had a lot more action, adventure and humor. Plus, it was shorter.

 Having said all of this, I realize that the book is so smart that I can see people absolutely loving it, and I understand why. For me, I prefer more character development. It comes down to personal preference for a writing style. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book. 
 Now, do I feel the same way about Alice in Wonderland, a fair comparison to this book? No. I felt more connected to Alice and her world.

Jess is the middle child in a family of girls and feels like he gets the short end of the stick a lot. Then Leslie moves in next door. Her parents are hippies and she is a bit different than all the other country kids in the area. 
 On the first day of school, Leslie beats not only Jess but all the other boys in the races. This does not endear her to any of them. It takes a while but eventually Jess and Leslie become friends. They start hanging out across the creek in the woods. Leslie christens it Terabithia and names them queen and king. To get to Terabithia you must swing on a rope across a creek and then enter the woods. When the creek is up this can be a bit dangerous. 
 Life in Terabithia is fun and carefree, unlike real life where Jess and Leslie have to deal with difficulties at home and school. Jess's dad loses his job and the family struggles financially. Leslie craves the attention of her parents who are very busy. Jess also struggles with the fact that he loves art and drawing but his family thinks it is a waste of his time. Only his teacher Miss Edmunds appreciates his talent. 
 This book deals with a lot in a short number of pages. It does just gloss over most of the tougher issues and doesn't really delve into them. There are hints of child abuse and neglect and bullying that are not really dealt with at all. The tragedy at the end of the book isn't even given that much attention. Sure it is just an accident and no one bares the blame except perhaps Mother Nature, but you would think there would be more about Jess dealing with it. What I loved about this book was that it showed kids being kids, using their imaginations in a way that most adults forget how to do. I remember creating the most elaborate scenarios as a kid with nothing but sticks and cardboard boxes or hay bales. The mind of a child is a wonderfully creative place and I think we sometimes forget that today. We load kids up with toys and electronic gadgets and they forget how to use their imaginations or be creative. It is a bit sad. 
 Previous Review: 
 I've been meaning to read this book for years. I've seen the movie so I knew what was going to happen, but I had never read the book. The book in some ways reminded me of childhood. Playing with friends, making things up and imagining things, not needing a lot to have fun. I think a lot of kids miss out on that aspect of childhood today; they are too connected to things...internet, media, tv, games. They don't have the imagination for something like Terabithia, which is sad. This book deals with some pretty heavy topics, but unfortunately it just brushes over them. There isn't a whole lot of in depth reflection on some of the topics even the big topic of the death at the end. It was a good book and I am sure for its time it was pretty ground breaking.",3,-0.258,-0.182,0.798

 Strengths: I'm starting to see a bit of a resurgence in fantasy reading in my library, especially the variety that involves swords. This is a good choice for readers who are transitioning from Erin Hunter to John Flanagan's Ranger's Apprentice books. 
 Weaknesses: The mice talk. And they wear jerkins. Why? Why do they wear jerkins underneath modern New York City? WHy this elaborate pseudo-medieval power structure? Makes no sense at all. Why not 1920s gangland rats and mice? Tommy guns instead of swords? Fedoras instead of capes?

The name of each character is funny too, like Mr. & Mrs. Wizzard, Uncle Drac (who fond of bats and keep them in his room), even Araminta Spookie itself is a funny name.

561,"Mike Lester's A is for Salad puts an interesting twist on the alphabet book. The critters depicted in the book (alligator, beaver, etc.) follow the normal progression of letters, but the action they are involved in what the letter is ""for"" (i.e. the alligator is eating salad, so ""A"" is for ""salad""). The actual names of all the featured creatures are given on the endpapers at the back of the book. 
 I thought Lester's artwork (cartoon) was fun--he does a good job drawing action--but overall I thought the concept was a bit limited. Perhaps the silliness has more staying power with the target audience of beginning readers, but I was tired of it midway through. 
 I read one review that described the book as ""an advanced lesson for kids who have a good handle on the alphabet but you want to make sure they understand and aren't doing it by rote."" This definitely seems true, but without proper selection this book could easily be picked up by a child not so advanced in alphabet knowledge--and it'd be thoroughly confusing!",3,0.023,0.625,0.923

 Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is a woman who lives in an upside-down house and smells like cookies. Children love her and she loves them. Most of the story is parents calling Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle for advise in dealing with children who are misbehaving. One little boy won't eat more than a nibble. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle suggest giving him smaller & smaller plates until his plate is the size of a quarter. Then she tells the boy it is his day to take care of her pony, but he is too weak to do so. He starts eating again because he wants to be able to do fun things. Another little girl has a fit when she is given a bath. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle tells the parents not to make her bathe. And after 3 weeks, they should press radish seeds on the girl while she sleeps. When the seeds start to sprout, the little girl is so freaked out, she can't wait to get in the bath. Two other kids can't stop fighting. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle tells the parents to act just like the girls do. But the end of the day, the girls are so unhappy listening to the parents fighting all the time, that they beg them to stop & they promise to stop fighting themselves. Another little boy wont' put his toys away. His mother is sick of cleaning up after him. There are many more examples of the advice Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle gives. Overall, the stories are very funny & silly & kids would enjoy. It is clear that this is written in the 1940s/1950s, but that wouldn't' stop a child from enjoying it.",3,-0.131,0,0.957

567,"Deborah Ellis interviewed the children of service members from the United States and Canada on their thoughts and opinions. We learn of their feelings about having a parent serve in a war, their life at home and how it differs from the average child, whether they plan to join the military, and what are their goals in life. Interviewed are children of varying ages, backgrounds, and situations, so the reader gets a wide spectrum of views. 
 I enjoyed reading the first four interviews or so, but then felt like I was hearing the same thing over and over. I wanted to notice what made this child or family different from the previous one and I didn't see much. I can see some becoming bored and not finishing the book, but I hope they will at least skip to the last two stories. One was an interview with a child whose father died in Iraq and another whose father is a conscientious objector to the war. To me, these last ones were the most fascinating, and maybe that's because they stood out from the others. 
 I did sense an underlying anti-war message from the author, but one I think she tried to minimize. I got the feeling that she tried to be as neutral as possible about the issue. I'm glad I read the book, for it does give one much to ponder. I just wish I could have been more engaged with the stories of these children. I give it a 'C.'",3,-0.146,0.467,0.931

573,"Hound Dog True is a quiet, middle grade novel about a girl named Mattie Breen, who is extremely shy, and worries about many things. She and her mom have had to move a lot, due to changes and shifts in her mom's jobs, and that has made the prospect of starting fifth grade at yet another new school even more frightening. This time, though, Mattie has a plan. Since her Uncle Potluck is the janitor at the school, she's going to learn everything there is to know about his work and then become his apprentice so she can avoid having to socialize with her classmates during recess. Her apprenticeship to Uncle Potluck takes an unexpected turn, however, and she realizes she's going to have to face her peers. To do so, she will also have to face some demons from her past and perhaps even trying making friends with Quincy Sweet, an older, cooler girl in her new neighborhood. 
 I am having a hard time collecting my thoughts about this book. I really wanted to read it, since I loved A Crooked Kind of Perfect so much, but somehow I didn't connect with it as well as I expected. The book has a lot of really strong elements. For example, I loved the specificity of Mattie's experiences. The very simplest of things, such as the loss of a pajama button, or the violation of a private notebook by a nosy classmate, take on a deep and almost indescribable significance in Mattie's life, which really drew her out as a character and provided a lot of insight into her personality and anxieties. I also thought Mattie's shyness was one of the strongest aspects of the book. I think it's difficult to understand the paralyzing feeling of not knowing how to interact with other kids, and even more difficult to put into words, but Urban pulls it off. 
 Still, though, something in this book didn't work for me. I liked many of the individual story threads, but I never felt like those threads formed one cohesive whole. I was frequently confused, particularly by the continuous use of the word ""plunk,"" and by Mattie's devastation over her lost pajama button, and her need to apologize to it. I could understand her feelings well enough from a logical standpoint, but I never got to the point where I also felt them myself. Usually, I can get into a child's mindset when I'm reading a children's book, but I never saw Mattie from anything but an adult point of view. One of the reviews I saw on Goodreads mentioned that this book would be adored by adults, but maybe not so much by children, and that's the impression it gave me. The writing is strong, even if I wasn't crazy about all of the characters, and the childhood difficulties Mattie faces are the kinds of things people of all ages can recognize from their own lives, but I didn't connect with Mattie, and I suspect middle grade readers may not either.",3,-0.134,0.048,0.87

 The illustrations weren't that big of a hit for me since I really didn't like how the little girl's face was drawn. Otherwise some of the other illustrations were lovely done with intricate details and of course the bright colors that will entrap the reader with their beauty.

 Hazel has always been best friends with Jack. Now that they're in fifth grade her mother is urging her to try to make some new friends, and Jack is sometimes torn between spending his time with her and spending his time with other boys in their grade. The two have a disagreement and right after the disagreement Jack suddenly falls to the ground in what seems to be excruciating pain. Hazel doesn't know it, but Jack has gotten a shard of glass from an enchanted mirror in his eye, and it travels to his heart. After that moment Jack is distant with her and shortly thereafter disappears into the woods. Hazel takes off to try to save him and finds herself in an enchanted land where nothing is as it seems. 
 Breadcrumbs is divided into two parts - the part that takes place in the real world, and the part that takes place in the fantasy world. The first part seems to take up most of the book, although as far as page count goes, is roughly the same length as the second part. Too much time is spent on the first part, setting up the relationship of Hazel and Jack, and as a result the second part with the rich fantasy world seems hasty and rushed. Avid readers will enjoy the literary illusion that encompasses the whole book, from the loose interpretation of The Snow Queen that is the bulk of the book, to the mini glimpses of Hans Christen Anderson fairy tales such as The Little Match Stick Girl, to the musings of the main character comparing her life and what is happening to her to different tales she has read (or seen - I didn't miss that Star Wars reference!).

 As an adult, the BFG's speech was a bit annoying and reminded me a bit too much of Jar Jar Binks. Other characters were less amazing than I remembered them - the Queen held a rather low opinion of the Middle East, for example, and Sophie could be a bit of a snot, but to be fair, she'd just been kidnapped and told she could never go home. But together they managed to stop the bad giants from eating any more people and save the world. 
 Despite the BFG's assertion that humans are the only species on Earth that kills each other being false, it's still a good point - it's not terribly civilised to kill each other. We're all human, so lets treat each other as such, eh?",3,-0.154,0.222,0.62

632,"My copy was provided by Netgalley. 
 Lily has three siblings who are like her: a little weird. She also has an absentee father and an almost absentee mother. Lily just wants her family to stay together. She doesn't want to be split up. She doesn't want her mother taken away. Yet when her mother goes away for a vacation with her new boyfriend in a freaking different country, Lily has to watch the kids all alone. Lily must hide from her nosey neighbors that her mother is gone, but things get difficult when the kids get cranky and they run out of money for food. 
 To hide from adults, Lily takes the kids on a little adventure in a park where they hopefully won't be found. They will have to get food somehow and evade capture. It sounds like fun, but Lily has to learn that being an adult isn't as fun as she thinks it is. 
 First off, what kind of mother leaves her kids when she's going to a different country? She barely knows her boyfriend and she decides to go on vacation with him. The guy didn't even know about the freaking kids she has. This bit felt unrealistic to me. What kind of mother would do that to her children? 
 Lily was a great character. The author really made me feel as if I was actually in an eleven-year-old's mind. Sometimes, she just wanted to have fun and didn't have any worries. Yet she sometimes had the weight of the world on her shoulders. She had to keep her family happy and together which is hard to do when they just want their mom. Wilson captured Lily's emotions so well as she made them so vivid. I could feel the anguish Lily felt when at times she hated her mother, but she really loved her the whole time, no matter what she did. 
 The siblings were really funny. Wilson didn't make them scarce or have no character. All four of the siblings had distinct personalities that were interesting and amusing. 
 Lily tried to use her imagination to solve her problems and when these solutions failed, it shows kids that not everything you try to do will turn out well. At times, things just don't work out the way you want it to. 
 Some of the language and concepts seemed inappropriate for a children's book. Basically, there were things that included credit card theft, stealing, and begging. It seemed like it was okay to steal if you're starving and there won't be any consequences for it. 
 But this book was cute and entertaining. It was interesting and made me laugh at the kid's antics at times. I would have liked a less abrupt ending as it seemed to finish too soon.",3,-0.085,-0.02,0.99

 Si bien me ha gustado bastante, me parece que tiene algunos aspectos debiles: poco desarrollo individual de los personajes Klas y Klara (parte bien en este sentido, pero luego decae); algunos puntos insustanciales o inverosimiles que restan potencia al conjunto de la historia (el anillo, el senor que vende el anillo, el ojo de Talentoso, la relacion entre las hermanas Aleteo y Nana y la lucha entre ellas...) ; y los dialogos entre Aleteo y Talentoso (un poco flojos, la verdad). 
 Se lamenta el sexismo, por cierto, sobre todo tratandose de una obra infantil, pero tampoco podia ser de otra manera; hay que tener en cuenta que es de 1964, y ambientada en una epoca aun bastante mas preterita.

671,"A strong 3.5 or 3.75, rounded up to 4. This book passed the crying-in-public test, which means I had the chance to show strangers my ugly crying face while reading. 
 The book has an unusual format, where different members of a 5th grade class take turns relating the events that happen; in fact, we often get the chance to see the same event from several different viewpoints. I did like how each of the kids' chapters was written in a somewhat different style. I didn't care for the obviously contrived valley girl style used for Alexia. I did enjoy the more eloquent style given to the big reader, Jessica, and the very structured, logical style used by Luke. 
 I would have given the book a higher rating, but while it covers several very emotional and serious topics (and deals with them well), I felt like the buildup to these events was too sudden. I guess I feel like the book should have been a bit longer, and should have taken more time to develop the characters and set the scene for the major event in the last part of the story. (I hesitate to say more for fear of giving away spoilers.) 
 All of that being said, this is a good book for juvenile readers. It deals with issues like family and death in a straightforward, but not sensational, way.

 Helping them along the way is their great-uncle Merriman Lyon, who functions in a mentor type role.

Illustrator Will Hillenbrand has portrayed bear as a gentle giant and loveable critter for the young child to whom you will be reading this book. 
 Most children have a stuffed teddy bear that they already love. So it is somewhat an understatement that they love bears already. Well, here is another that they will love. There are teddy bear stories abounding in libraries and book stores - example: Winnie the Pooh, that beloved Pooh-bear. So it is not a far stretch to say that the child in your life will fall in love with 'bear' in Bear in Love. 
 Author Daniel Pinkwater understands children and what they like to hear and see in a story. So he has created a gentle bear who awakens to a gift from an unknown friend. A friend he wants to engage. A friend whom he, too, tries to befriend with a gift. 
 Amble along with bear as he discovers his new friend. Enjoy the beautiful illustrations. Have the child to whom you are reading this book discover details in the art and in the story that enlighten and teach. Enjoy!

702,"This ended up being a very satisfying read. I'm sure if I'd read this at age 10, it would have been a 5 star book for me. I would have particularly enjoyed the episodic adventures of Dolf and the children when I was that age. 
 I very quickly had to suspend my adult sensibilities major disbelief and try to put myself back to my 9 or 10 or 11 year old self, eager for a fantasy novel. I'm not talking about the time travel aspect, but there is no way that scientists, let alone a father, would let happen what happened at the beginning of this book, especially not in that hasty and ill thought out manner. 
 I became so curious so I had to look up the history, and I found living history. Interesting. Interesting take the book has too. A friend when we were fifteen was interested in children's crusades and I think that they deepened her Christian beliefs; I wonder what she'd think about new thinking on the subject. 
 This particular story and its opinions felt very 1970s to me. The author wrote it and it was published first in the Netherlands (great translation, I think) but it did not have a foreign feel to me. 
 I liked how the religious-not religious and those from different centuries learned from one another. 
 As a non-religious person I liked that Dolf was not religious but wondered throughout the book if that would last, and I also wondered about whether the whole big picture would change. I loved how that was resolved. It felt so real that only the time travel aspect felt like speculative fiction. I do wonder how some religious Christians would feel about this children's novel, and I wonder if it's on any banned lists. 
 Something I did not like was when a narrator comes in occasionally to explain what the Middle Ages were like; the information is interesting and I'm glad it was included, but I wish it had been incorporated in a less clumsy way. Another negative was the extremely abrupt ending, reminiscent of A Wrinkle in Time, but I forgive it for that. In fact, it's fun to imagine the reactions of some of the characters in the book after the what happens at the end of the story in the book.

708,"Finding it impossible to keep secrets, Debbie Bass is soon named the Big Mouth Bass by her brother. The nickname sticks and haunts the young girl as she lives her life as a 4th grader in 1963. 
 The story is a year in Debbie's life as chronicled in her journal. She addresses her musings to God and fills the pages in her journal with every day, humorous and sometimes heart breaking tales. 
 I read this book, easily, in one afternoon. It's short and sweet and a hard book to set aside. Once upon a time I had boxes of journals, and in a cleaning frenzy I threw them all away. Reading this book made me wish I hadn't, made me wish I could go back and read all the little things I found so important that I had to write them down. 
 I can see this book appealing to all ages. Kids around the 4th and 5th grade ages could relate easily to her stories. Debbie's character is flawed and feels a little awkward in her shoes. A common feeling at that age, I am sure. Adults might appreciate the history in this book a little more than the kids. Most adults who were around in the 60's know exactly where they were when Kennedy was shot. Debbie journals about the day and the impact that it had on her and her family. It's really a fascinating little story. 
 It's amazing the changes that can occur in one year of a lifetime and this book narrates one girls journey, beautifully. This looks to be the first book in a series of Debbie's journals, I would love to read more!

709,"This volume contains both Alice in Wonderland and Through the looking-glass, along with annotations by well-known mathematician Martin Gardner. I read few months ago the first story with no annotations, and, even if I liked it, I felt like I was missing something. There are a lot of historical and cultural references that are impossible to get if you are not a Victorian England expert. One of my colleagues came to the rescue and borrowed me this version of the book, and, what a difference those annotation made! It was like reading a different book. Even more interesting was the critical introduction, that really changed my perception of it. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson had a strong fascination for young girls, that was apparently common during the Victorian times. The author cultivated his friendships with his young friends, created stories full of wonders and references to nursery rhymes to fascinate them. The book has plenty of this, mixed with a sense of sorrow at the realization that the child-friends are growing fast and with fear that they are going to forget the author. It is definitely quite an interesting book. I strongly recommend an annotated version to truly understand it and appreciate it.",4,-0.031,0.6,0.985

There are blops of different sizes, different colors, and they do a variety of things too. Concepts are taught cleverly, such as mixing colors, what appears in a mirror, and opposites. 
 While there are punch-out pages at the end of the book, this would still make a great pick for libraries to circulate. I was particularly pleased with the mirror page and color mixing pages that add a special twist and fun to the book.

 There is no point where your own story is over and the rest of your life is just an epilogue. Beatrice was dead before the series even started and it can still be thought of as her story.

Sheldon Curtis (Say) is lying near a Southern battlefield. When Pinkus Aylee finds him, he carries the wounded boy back to his mother's house. She nurses him back to health, and the two boys become friends. Tragedy strikes, and as they're on their way back to join the Union troops, they are captured by Confederate troops and separated once they reach a camp for prisoners of war. The story is filled with poignant moments and hints of the indignity of slavery. Even though Pink was that rare slave who had been taught how to read by his master, he was certain that he had done so for his own convenience and not out of kindness.

There is a lot to be analyzed and discussed within this text, including gender roles and relationships, however, consider that this story was written as a Christmas gift to Huxley's niece. It was published posthumously and was not written specifically to be published. It was written in a time when women were treated like silly creatures to be owned (even more so than today's society). Perhaps this was nothing more than a tongue and cheek story meant to bring laughs with the nasty characters and the silliness of Crows living in a tree but shopping in a grocery store?

738,"Five-year-old Pelle-Goran, who is ordinarily a very well-behaved little boy, has begun acting out as a result of his mother's recent injury which has kept her confined to a hospital bed. Though his mother is expected to recover, Pelle-Goran's father thinks it will be better for everyone if Pelle-Goran goes away on a holiday to his grandmother's house. While visiting his grandmother, Pelle-Goran gets to know his cousin, Kaja, who is an orphan, as well as a variety of colorful characters who live near the farm. While his mother convalesces back home, Pelle-Goran helps to reunite an estranged grandfather with his grandchildren, discovers whether dogs can talk, and learns to make a spettecake, the gift he has promised to the doctor for curing his mother. 
 This novel, translated from Swedish and set in Sweden, is a charming story of the same variety as The Good Master, wherein a child steps out of his comfort zone and begins to grow up as a result of the experience. Pelle-Goran, though seemingly obnoxious at the start of the book is actually a sympathetic and sweet protagonist. His concern for his mother, as well as his innocence about farm living, make it easy to root for him, and his friendship with cousin Kaja is a strong element of the story. Because Pelle-Goran likes to hear stories, there are also a few Swedish folktales interspersed throughout the novel, which give the book a little extra cultural flavor. Though much of the story feels universal, and could happen on a farm in any country, these folktales help to give the American reader a little insight into Swedish customs. 
 The Spettecake Holiday wasn't exactly the kind of book I had in mind when I first chose family stories as this month's theme for the Old School Kidlit Reading Challenge, but it winds up being a good fit. Not only does Pelle-Goran worry for his mother, but he also grows closer in affection to his grandmother and cousin and witnesses and helps to resolve the difficulties between two of the neighborhood children and their own grandfather. The story itself is largely episodic, and sometimes I found myself wondering if anything was ever going to happen, but what seems to be at its heart is the importance of family and the value of their support in enduring childhood difficulties. Overall, I found it to be an enjoyable and gentle tale, appropriate for reading aloud to kids as young as five or six. In addition to The Good Master, The Spettecake Holiday would also pair well with the 2015 novel, Adventures with Waffles by Maria Parr, which is set in Norway and is also a work of translation.

 Ivan is an easygoing gorilla. Living at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade, he has grown accustomed to humans watching him through the glass walls of his domain. He rarely misses his life in the jungle. In fact, he hardly ever thinks about it at all. 
 Instead, Ivan thinks about TV shows he's seen and about his friends Stella, an elderly elephant, and Bob, a stray dog. But mostly Ivan thinks about art and how to capture the taste of a mango or the sound of leaves with color and a well-placed line. 
 Then he meets Ruby, a baby elephant taken from her family, and she makes Ivan see their home--and his own art--through new eyes. When Ruby arrives, change comes with her, and it's up to Ivan to make it a change for the better. 
 Plot: 
 To me, this plot was so simplistic, but so relatable. As an animal activist, I completely get all of the troubles the animals faced in a mall/zoo. At times it was sad to think that millions of animals have to go through so much worse than what was faced in this book. I hope The One and Only Ivan made people realize what a terrible idea it is to lock animals up in tiny cages or habitats. 
 Writing: 
 I went into this book thinking it would be a middle grade book with small font. Instead, I got a children's book with the largest font. Which is totally fine. Even though the writing was very simplistic and for children, I still really enjoyed it all the same. In a way, some of the ""chapters"" (they were only one page) were poetic and could be considered poems. 
 Characters: 
 I really enjoyed all of the animals in this book. Of course, they didn't have any depth, but it was still fascinating to see the world through Ivan's eyes.

 I would recommend this for 2nd+. This was a cute, lovable story that is perfect for all ages.",4,-0.036,0.368,0.985

772,"Oh Rebecca! As a child I felt myself to be like her (though I was certainly more ungainly among my year-mates than she ever was) in the lively imagination... and Rebecca and her colleague Pollyanna taught me to pay attention to the beauties of life, to other people (no matter how dull one might think them at first), and to believe in happier endings. 
 So, at least in my childhood, this book served the purpose for which it was written. Re-reading it as an adult, I still found myself weeping a bit over poor Rebecca's reaction to being scolded at her hour of triumph. While Misunderstood Betsy and Anne of Green Gables came later, I have to think that Rebecca carried more of my heart than Anne, let alone Betsy-- Caddie Woodlawn outstripped them, and of course Laura Ingalls. 
 I wanted to be as strong of purpose and as useful as these young girls, knowing that I too came from a background that would require hard work to rise from; I wanted to be respected in a way that was already outdated when I learned of it. Perhaps having these sorts of role models (however subconcious) made me a little odd and stiff, and certainly fostered in me a self-criticism that perhaps my peers didn't have. Certainly the ideas of what a child could and should do to support the family I took from these were old-fashioned then, and still more now; in fact, the kind of upbringing these girls had-- and, for instance, the Pepper (and how they grew) would be considered child neglect nowadays... But I grew up responsible, so it wasn't all bad, and it helped me to weather some bad times. 
 Wiggins' writing of the beauties of nature, despite it's 19th century New England fanciness, still touches me; if I could teach my son to see things that way, I would be pleased: 
 ""...there's a brook, but not a common brook. It has young trees and baby bushes on each side of it, and it's a shallow chattering little brook with a white sandy bottom and lots of little shiny pebbles. Whenever there's a bit of sunshine the brook catches it, and it's always full of sparkles the livelong day."" 
 Spoiler: as Rebecca becomes a teen, there is an older man who takes an interest in her, and some readers not nursed on 19th century literature will probably be appalled; but unlike, say, Daddy-long-legs he makes no move and shows no overt interest, I think we can forgive him for an attraction that was willing to bide its time.",4,-0.154,0.278,0.982

 This book didn't quite feel like an Applegate book (at least, it felt nothing like Ivan or Home of the Brave). It felt like a Cynthia Lord book, or a Rebecca Stead, or... something else. I don't know if this is a bad thing. 
 Obviously I love cats, so I should adore this book. And I did really like it. It just felt... I'm not sure. It felt like nothing really happened. Which isn't true, because a lot happened, and there were a lot of feelings, and a lot of strife and difficulty. Maybe it was that everything leading up to the climax of the book was so well laid out - that we knew what was coming. 
 All that said. A Hole is to Dig is one of my absolute favorite books, and so I adored that Applegate used it so fluidly here. I adored Jacks' caring for his sister Robin, and his fear at seeing Crenshaw again, and then his friend Marisol's comfort. 
 It was good. I just don't think it was as good as I wanted it to be. 
 I also, reading this on a Kindle, experienced a lot of formatting hijinks - which didn't detract from my reading of it, but did make me certain to put a hold on a physical copy of the book so that I can see what it really looks like.",4,0.197,0.6,0.964

791,"The poems in A Curious Collection of Cats are tightly written and none of the rhymes feel forced. The illustrations are brilliantly colored, eye-catching, and filled with movement that underlines and enhances the meaning of each poem. 
 Just to give a taste of what the book is like, I'll describe three of the poems. 
 A Tree for Samantha 
 This elegy for a cat who always knew its owner's moods and how to care for them is a bittersweet tribute to what pet lovers feel for their animals. Its lines are printed along the deep brown trunk and branches of a tree planted in the memory of the lost cat, and the poem ends simply, and sadly: 
 The oak is strong, and it will make good climbing when it grows. 
 But it will never guess I'm sad and kiss me on the nose. 
 Binky's Kitty 
 This poem is about a litter of kittens. Though the words are cute and fun, the real poetry is in the illustration. The kittens tumble across the floor, claw their way up the furniture, and sleep in a pile, paws entangled. The end of the poem reveals that it will be difficult to choose just one kitten to take home. 
 Cat Door 
 Of all the poems in this book, this one fit my notion of concrete poetry the best. Max, depicted as nothing more than a blue shadow against a gold background, is shown squeezing through the cat door. The refrain ""Max squeezes through the cat door"" is repeated several times, but loses a word with each repetition, as the entire line disappears through the door along with the silhouette of the cat's body. Simple, but so well done. 
 I think this book is a great one for introducing concrete poetry to elementary school kids, and also just a creative and humorous celebration of cats. Recommended to cat lovers and poetry fans.",4,0.012,0.282,0.993

I was a little nervous about how it would work, but it totally did! The mystery is perfect for the younger crowd without it being scary or intense but with plenty of intrigue to keep kids engaged. The characters are nine and eleven and I'd say that's a pretty good range for its audience as well. If you have a kid who's ready to graduate from Nate the Great, this would be a perfect next step! And it would make for a fun read-aloud for parents who know the characters and to get everyone's take on who they think did it as the story goes on!

803,"Breadcrumbs is a charming and enchanting new novel by Anne Ursu. Billed as Middle Grade fiction, the lyrical writing and interesting mix of fantasy and reality will appeal to Young Adult and Adult readers alike. 
 Breadcrumbs is an emotional journey that follows Hazel as she navigates a dangerously magical forest on her quest to reach the Snow Queen's lair and rescue her best friend Jack. One of the many things I enjoyed about Breadcrumbs is that it evoked such nostalgic memories of my own childhood. There is an almost natural separation that happens in boy/girl friendships at a certain age and Ursu highlights this with such poignancy that it is beautiful to read. 
 Hazel shone as the main character and her courage, loyalty, and fortitude were inspiring. I loved her whimsical nature, her willingness to trust her intuition as she faced some terrifying challenges and persevered through seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The way her character evolved throughout the story was wonderful. The quest that Hazel undertook was as much about self discovery as it was about the strength of friendship and Hazel learned something valuable with each step of the journey. 
 Within the story, there were nods to many other popular children's tales such as Harry Potter and Narnia and of course, the Snow Queen which inspired this novel. These mentions made sense in the context of the story and I don't feel that they were overused at all. 
 This was an emotional and whimsical modern fairy tale with overtones of melancholy and nostalgia. This is one of those reads that stays with you long after turning the last page, a modern day classic. I would recommend this to readers of all ages and would go so far as to say that you will be missing out if you don't have a copy of this on your shelf.",4,0.163,0.677,0.996

 - I really loved and connected to Sol's sense of duty and protectedness and ever-present concern for Ming. If a little sister is sad, hell, us big sisters will do anything we can to make them feel better. For Sol, it was through stories.

Since it was awarded the Caldecott Medal in the year of my birth, I've always been fond of it. In fact, I can remember reading it when I was very young. I still like it even after all these years. While changes in publishing trends and artistic techniques are obvious when comparing a picture book like this one with one published in 2015, for instance, this one stands as a lovely classic, ideal for sharing aloud and preserving a story that remains woven into the fabric of our culture. Readers will savor the magical touch of the fairy godmother's wand that changes an enormous pumpkin into a coach, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, a rat into a coachman, and Cinderella into the belle of the prince's ball, complete with a lovely frock. Of course, the story ends on a happy note, even if undeserved, as the unkind stepsisters are forgiven, and as the author writes, ""She begged them to love her always"" (unpaged). I should certainly hope they would. Long before I knew what an endpaper was, I can remember staring for hour at these, replicas of the cover, and being fascinated by the magically-transformed troupe on its way to the ball.",4,0.409,0.778,0.996

It was interesting to learn about the different depths of the ocean and find out what animals live at certain levels. 
 There were two things that I felt could have been better. The first is that some of the illustrations didn't plan for the gutter very well and fish heads got stuck in the fold of the book, which made it kind of difficult to see all the nicely rendered details. The second is that I felt like some information was sacrificed for the sake of the rhyme. I would have preferred a non-rhyming book so that we could have gotten more facts about the animals.

819,"Thursdays With the Crown by Jessica Day George is the third book in the Tuesdays at the Castle series. The story picks up right where Wednesdays in the Tower leaves off, so I would suggest reading the story in order for the most enjoyment. Castle Glower has been acting weird, so it's no surprise when two towers transport Celie, her siblings, and friends to an unknown land. The kids and Celie's pet griffin Rufus set out through the forest to figure out where they are and what has happened to their beloved Castle. Instead, they discover two wizards and an entire lost people, the oldest inhabitants of Castle Glower. And it seems they may know more of the Castle's secrets than Celie. But who is telling the truth and how will they get home? 
 Thursdays With the Crown continues with the same balance of adventure, fantasy, and character development that I expect from Day. Celie is still growing, and despite being the youngest of the group is a smart and independent young lady. I like the relationships that continue to grow and change, and the individual character growth in the core group of characters. I think that the adventure in this installation is very important. Readers discover more about the Castle's origins and the conflicts in the land it was originally sent from. Like most disagreements the clashes of the past linger, and each side has their own version of events, each with a grain of truth. I think that this is a good lesson to help kids understand large conflicts, as well as making the story exciting. 
 Thursdays With the Crown is a perfect continuation of the story, but it really does need the foundation of the previous books to be enjoyed.

 ""It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success."" 
 Awwww well this book was just a feel coaster. Wonder is a very heartwarming and uplifting story about a boy with severe facial abnormalities that goes to school for the first time and has to deal with every day life. 
 What Auggie has gone through is terrible, but the book itself is filled with a lot of humor and Palacio really makes Auggie such an amazing character. It's hard not to root for him in every situation. He's funny and very intelligent and you really get drawn into his life and what he has to deal with on the day-to-day basis. 
 I actually thought this book would be exclusively told from Auggie's POV but was surprised to find 5-6 other characters POV throughout the book. Most of the time I'm not one to exactly enjoy that, but in this case, every single time we saw a new perspective we learned something new; I personally thought that made this story even better; to see so many different perspectives on Auggie's life. 
 I think one thing that interested me though - which I have seen a few other people mention - is how this story is so positive and joyous. I think at times it felt a bit unrealistic that every single person was always so happy.

 I love to read these poems especially on days when I feel sad or angry, because these poems always cheer me up and make me laugh. 
 Oh man, I can't help but laugh every single time I read, 'The Sitter'. That poem's all kinds of crazy but in a hilarious way. To read about a baby-sitter actually sitting on a baby is horrifying, but for me what makes the poem funny, is that it seems to be told from an older sibling of the baby's POV. 
 'How Not To Have To Dry The Dishes' makes me remember being a pre-teen and a teenager and feeling the same way as the little girl in the poem. I won't deny that I used to look for any and every excuse to get out of doing the dishes, and this poem just brings a smile to my face. 
 From 'Shaking,' to 'Put Something In,' to 'Snake Problem,' to 'Bear In There', to 'Hurk' and more. These poems make laugh and I love reading them to and with my niece and oldest nephew, where we laugh like crazy every single time we read this book. 
 Mr. Silverstein's gift for writing amazing and funny poetry will always be around in years to come, and I just love that. I can't get enough of his books and I wish he had written lots more before passing away. 
 I'll have to check out his other books and see if I like them. And since Mr. Silverstein's a pretty wonderful poet and author, I'm more than sure that I'll like and/or love his other books.",5,0.047,0.379,0.997

849,"*I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review* 
 This book surprised me in many ways. For example, I didn't expect to remember middle school so vividly, and how terrible it can be. I had almost forgotten the whole experience, but the writing was so vivid and true to my own experiences (in some ways) that this book brought it all back. And I'm still giving it five stars! ;-) 
 The main character is believable, relatable, and quirky in many ways I identify with. The supporting characters are all distinct and well developed and round out the whole story. 
 This story is heartbreaking and emotional (though ultimately hopeful and positive) so be prepared to shed a few tears. 
 The pacing is perfect for the story and the way it develops. I really enjoyed the combination of flashbacks and current action and the way the first and second person were used to help distinguish between the two. 
 I loved learning a ton about jellyfish and other topics. 
 My normal breakdown for book reviews has fallen apart, but this book was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed it even though it's geared at a much younger age group (middle school, for me, was 20 years ago now...). I recommend it to readers of all ages especially anyone who has ever taught middle school or anyone who remembers what it was like to be there.",5,-0.042,0.5,0.996
850,"2017 Review: 
 I've read this book a thousand times, but this was my first time listening to the audiobook. Honestly, I think this one reads better in print. The audiobook wasn't bad at all but some of the word play (with Stanley/Yelnats) works better when you can see the letters, in my opinion. 
 For some reason, listening to the audiobook brought back very vivid memories of the movie, as well, which was fun. 
 I definitely enjoyed this book more as a child, but it was fun for an adult, as well. And it's written so intelligently with the different layers and time periods. Normally I find myself getting bored when a book switches back and forth too much but this one handles it well. 
 Review in 2008: 
 I read this book in two hours this time around. I've read it a thousand times and it's one of those books that you love to pieces, no matter what. Ahhh <3333 I caught so many new things this time around. I loved the characters even more. I noticed more little details that you get. Squid up in the middle of the night with ""allergies""? Awwwww. Why did I never even notice that when I was younger? But, anyway, if you've read it before and haven't picked it up in years....do it. It gets better with age. I'm not reading it with the same delight that comes from reading it for the first time or the same feelings of being in the midst of obsession, but it's still good.",5,0.154,0.667,0.997

861,"Mr. Waldorf Travels to the Great State Of Texas by By Barbara Terry, Beth Ann Stifflemire and Vladimir Kirichenko 
 As picture books for children go this offers more than just a pleasant reading experience. This is the beginning of a series and said series provides information and education in a very entertaining and painless manner. In addition, the oft used but still extremely effective act of, including a lost or hidden object turns the reading experience into a game. 
 This specific book deals with a visit to Texas where Mr. Waldorf, a walking upright and talking Golden Labrador, discovers the sights and sounds of travel. Another feature that I particularly like is that the authors infuse the love of reading into Mr. Waldorf's character. Encouraging children to read should be a goal of every author.

I like thinking of these stories akin to a fantasy romp through an insane asylum. I would even go so far as to say that my interest in (and eventual decision to make a career out of) psychology stems from my early fascination with these stories. Not to mention my life-long obsession with fantasy. 
 I don't think Carroll was on drugs when writing this. 
 I do think Carroll was a stuffy traditional mathematician and this fantastic, insane chaos was his satirical retort to changes in math theory. But that doesn't stop me from ignoring anything mathematical and enjoying the story in all it's fantastic, insane and chaotic glory. 
 I would argue that there are more versions, remakes and spin-offs of Alice in Wonderland than any other work of literature, which I think speaks to the inspirational creativity of the story. My favorite remakes are the dark, insane, creepy, angular versions (e.g., Alice as a patient at a mental hospital).",5,-0.208,-0.13,0.896

You also learn that the Baudelaire parents poisoned someone at an opera with poison darts, and that Olaf's parents were killed by poison darts. And at the end, when Klaus tries to open the secret door with Olaf, and Violet tries to help get the boat off the roof, you get to see a real human side of him for the first time.

 A black servant named Ramoramor, but who is nicknamed Rame, is totally devoted to little Genevieve.

 George goes to a Jesuit school. Jacques, his cousin, also returns. The former does nothing and complains constantly, he is dismissed. The second is very appreciated by his teachers and has a very good memory of the school.

 Georges steals money from his father and wants to accuse Ramoramor, the black servant. Genevieve has seen everything, she adores Ramoramor, but she does not dare to overwhelm Georges' father, to reveal to him that his son is a thief. 
 She falls ill as a result of this terrible dilemma. She regains her health painfully. Mademoiselle Primerose discovered the truth and she has a proof. She sends a notary to the father; The notary presents an ultimatum to the father: if he does not renounce his tutor rights on Genevieve, a complaint will be filed with the imperial prosecutor and therefore the infamous conduct of his son will be exposed to the eyes of the whole world.

 I love the story of this friendship between two very different girls. In every way, this is a lovingly created book. 
 Both the story and pictures are so charming and funny, and they really capture the complexity of friendship. 
 I love the way color and art style were used in the pictures. 
 My favorite part was the imagination shown by Gollie when she climbs the mountain, and the humor shown in the notes on the door. Gollie's pancakes definitely made me hungry, and I read this very late at night/very early in the morning, not a time when I really wanted to eat. And, I like colorful socks. Everything with the fish was adorable too.

 I received this book from Netgalley in return for an honest review. 
 Rambling isles, sarcastic seaweed, seawigs, and plump nearsighted mermaids, oh my! 
 ""Oliver and the Seawigs"" is absolutely one of the best children's books that I have read in a while. It's funny, captivating, and I found myself being emotionally attached to the characters. I ate up this book in one morning, and I was begging for more, wanting to read more of Oliver, Cliff, Mr.Culpeper, and lovely Iris! 
 The story begins with Oliver, who is the only of two wild and adventurous explorers. All he wishes is for a normal life, with friends and not having to move around. But when all of a sudden his parents disappear, Oliver must go on an adventure to rival all other adventures. Atop the rambling isle Cliff, Oliver travels with Mr. Culpeper the albatross and Iris the nearsighted mermaid. 
 Most people would be a bit alarmed to find that their parents had disappeared along with a whole bunch of uncharted islands. They might feel inclined to call the police, or the coast guard, or just run about shouting. Not Oliver. He was a Crisp, and made of sterner stuff than that. 
 You're going to love this book. The humor is simple and fun, but not childish. The sarcastic seaweed and the adorable seamonkeys bring a whimsical touch. The characters feel real, and you become so very invested it's almost unnatural (I can't believe I shipped characters from a children's book!) The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, and blend in perfectly with the narrative as well as the About the Author and Illustrator sections at the end of the book. It is a short read but I was very captivated by the illustrations that I just took the time to look at it all. The details in the hair and seawigs are intricate, and clearly the illustrators took a long time in designing and making each beautiful piece. 
 ""My name,"" the boy said importantly, ""is Stacy de Lacey."" 
 ""But that's a girl's name!"" blurted Oliver. 
 Stacey de Lacey's face turned a dark shade of red.. ""Silence!"" he shouted. ""Stacy is one of those names that can be for a boy or a girl! Like Hilary, or Leslie, or...um...Anyway..."" 
 However, one of my favorite aspects of ""Oliver and the Seawigs"" is the character Iris. There is not often that you see a character in a book (no matter the genre) that is plump just for the sake of being so. She is a bigger girl but that is not an aspect of hers that is focused on or mocked, she just happens to be that way. There aren't many books that cater to this demographic, without having to involve a plot or subplot involving the character's weight. It's refreshing, and-I would say-very progressive. 
 ""So that's what you look like!"" she said, peering at Oliver through the thick lenses. ""Oh."" 
 ""What do you mean, 'Oh'?"" asked Oliver. 
 ""Nothing,"" said Iris. 
 Overall! I love this book. I've ordered my own copy so that I can keep it forever. I highly recommend this book to any parent who wants to enjoy a book with their kid...well...and pretty much everyone who wants to have a fun and lighthearted adventure with beautiful pictures to match. Go out and buy this book, then get dressed up in your finest seawig and hop aboard a Rambling Isle! And don't forget the sea monkeys!

906,"I love Oliver Jeffers' books, especially his series about the little boy, of which this is the first book. We had already read the next book, 
 Lost and Found 
 , the one where a lost penguin turns up on his doorstep and he tries to help it find its way home again - such a wonderful book! This one is just as delightful, and really captures the kids' imaginations. 
 In this story, the boy loves stars and wants one. He tries many different ways to catch a star, like climbing to the top of the tree to reach it, and comes up with some other ideas that turn out to be not so doable - like using his rocket ship to reach a star (except it's out of petrol from his last trip to the moon). The boy is persistent and determined, but an aura of sadness and loneliness surrounds him. He's very good at dealing with frustration and really thinks problems through, though he has a habit of asking birds for help and is always disappointed. 
 It has a happy ending, and the boy does get a star for a friend (or possibly just a washed-up dead starfish), but it's really interesting the range of emotions he goes through over the course of the story, and seeing how kids relate to them. Two-year-olds are especially attuned to characters from stories who become sad, and there is a scene where the boy is so forlorn and dejected that young readers are really concerned for him. All good signs of developing empathy. 
 Pair the sweet and ironic story with Jeffers' distinctive artistic illustrations, and you've got a really lovely book in your hands. This is one of those rare stories that I never get tired of reading - which is important, because my own two-year-old likes to have it read about three times in a row, in one sitting!",5,-0.08,0.176,0.964

915,"I had never heard of this classic English book until a friend said it was the favourite book of her childhood . . . and, indeed, a ""comfort read"" well into adulthood. Now I see it everywhere -- and I marvel that I could have been unaware of it for so long. 
 By the third paragraph, I knew that I would love it. 
 ""Humanity can be roughly divided into three sorts of people -- those who find comfort in literature, those who find comfort in personal adornment, and those who find comfort in food; and Miss Heliotrope, Maria, and Wiggins were typical representatives of their own sort of people."" 
 The writing is completely charming --in the sense that great charm is always allied to intelligence and wit. All of the sentences are beautifully wrought, and the magical setting (""Moonacre"")is so lovingly described that the reader can perfectly imagine it. 
 Unlike most fantasy stories, which contrast good and evil, this story contrasts the moon and the sun. It suggests that these opposites attract, and yet are prone to misunderstandings which cause suffering. Pride, mischief and obstinancy are the besetting sins, and the young heroine (Maria) has to undo several generations of misunderstanding in order to bring peace and happiness to Moonacre.

920,"That Makes Me Mad was a 1976 picture book written by Steven Kroll and illustrated by Hilary Knight. In 2002, the book was published again, this time with illustrations by Christine Davenier, who has illustrated the Dessert books by Hallie Durand and the Piper Reed series by Kimberly Willis Holt. Now the book has been revamped again, this time in comic format, as a toon book dedicated to the memory of Steven Kroll, who passed away in March. Though the story is now 35 years old, it is every bit as appealing now as I'm sure it was when it was first written. 
 Lots of things make Nina mad: 
 Getting in trouble for things she didn't do 
 Not being allowed to help 
 Not being able to find something 
 Being forced to go to bed 
 She feels better, though, when she has the chance to express her anger and figure out how to fix whatever is wrong. 
 The book is formatted so that the specific situation that makes Nina angry is always written out on the left-hand side of the page, and then illustrated through a short scenario on the right-hand side. Scenes take place everywhere - the living room, the bathroom, the park, the museum, even under the table - and each one explores a different type of frustration faced by children and adults alike. I was especially impressed by the universality of Nina's experiences. There were a number of situations mentioned in the book that I recognized as sources of my own anger at various times in my life that I had never articulated, or even considered trying to put into words. 
 I also really love the style of Knight's illustrations in this book. He's also the illustrator of Eloise, a favorite picture book from my childhood, and I noticed a lot of the same movement and personality in his drawings of Nina as appear in his drawings of Eloise. Having the opportunity to see the facial expressions Nina makes when she is angry throughout the book really enhances the overall reading experience, and adds a layer of humor to the text, which helps kids see the lighter side to the more difficult emotions associated with growing up. 
 Though the entire story is told in conversation bubbles, and the dialogue sounds very natural, the text really is quite simple and easy to read. The most difficult words I picked out were ""minute,"" ""wrong,"" ""painting,"" and ""dinosaur,"" and I also realized after reading the book a couple of times, that many words are actually repeated from scene to scene, reinforcing them for the new reader who is still learning to recognize words on sight. It's a credit to the talent of the author that I didn't really notice the text's simplicity until I went back and looked critically at the words he used. I think even the youngest readers can tell when quality has given way to simplicity, and it's wonderful when a book can maintain a high literary standard and still be easy enough for its audience to read independently. 
 I really like Toon Books, and I think this is one of the best. For read-alikes outside of the graphic format genre, try Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst, Noisy Nora by Rosemary Wells, and when Sophie Gets Angry Really, Really Angry by Molly Bang.",5,-0.303,0.073,-0.662

 De las ilustraciones no se exactamente que decirles sin quedarme corta, me quitan el aire, me arrebatan las palabras para expresar lo que siento al verlas. Lacombe tiene una capacidad deslumbrante para darle vida y personalidad a sus criaturas con algunas pinceladas, sin mucha complejidad. Cuando lo conoci pude ver en persona y comprobar que es ese tipo de artistas que viven exclusivamente para el arte, que es de lo mas talentoso y humilde que puede haber, sin duda un gran genio. 
 ""El herbario de las hadas"" es un libro que cumple varias funciones: es un herbario, es el intercambio de experiencias, conocimientos y tambien dolencias por medio de cartas, el encuentro de un hombre comun con un mundo de criaturas magicas y apasionantes. La historia que Sebastien Perez cuenta invita a amar a cada especimen que el protagonista va encontrando. No hay chance de que no te enamores de por lo menos uno de ellos, son todos sumamente adorables, con su caracter, su belleza y esencia, individualmente brindan sus pequenas cualidades que los distinguen de los otros. Algunos mas risuenos y carismaticos, otros mas melancolicos y quiza tambien mas peligrosos y severos. Pero como ya les he anticipado/remarcado anteriormente, todos tienen lo suyo y se hacen admirar facilmente. 
 El libro viene en formato tapa dura y es de gran tamano para que las ilustraciones se puedan apreciar apropiadamente. La estructura y el diseno del mismo son fascinantes, puesto que cuenta con paginas cuidadosamente caladas que ayudan a entrever pequenas criaturitas que esperan a que demos vuelta la pagina para descubrirlos y enamorarnos. Cuenta tambien con paginas traslucidas que permiten ver un poco mas alla de lo que normalmente vemos en las hojas comunes.

In the second volume, the details in the illustrations are explained. Pulling out various elements of the images, many things are revealed from favorite foods to festivals to children's book characters. There are paragraphs on each element so that readers truly start to understand Holland. 
 This book would not work in the same way without this format. Taking the time to linger on images makes for almost a journey to Holland as if you are gazing out a window and taking it all in. Then when you begin to wonder about something, you can turn to your guidebook and see what it is with wonderful details.

Momo und ihre Freuden sind echte Menschen, um die wir uns kummern, ihre Stadt ist eine echte Stadt, die wir besuchen wollen, und ihre Feinde sind echte Feinde, vor denen wir Angst haben. Ende ist ein Kinderschriftsteller, also sein Satzbau ist pragnant, und seine Handlung ist spannend. Es gefallt mir manchmal so ein Buch zu lesen, das so bewegend und nachdenklich ist, obwohl es so einfach zu lesen ist--oder weil es so einfach zu lesen ist. 
 Es geht um das moderne Leben. Ende macht kein neues Argument: unserer Welt fehlt spiritueller Bedeutung. Wir eilen uns immer. Wir streben nach Quantitat, nicht Qualitat. Wir pausen nie, und das Leben flieht von uns. Aber er ist eigentlich Optimist, wie Meng Tzu oder Rousseau, und er sieht in die Geister der Kinder die Quelle unserer Wiedergeburt. Wir alle sind spontan. Jede Stunde unseres Leben ist eine Gelegenheit, die man nur verlieren kann, wenn er vergisst sie zu benutzen. Momo ist eine genugsame Heldin, die stark ist, weil sie zuhoren kann, und teilt ihre Zeit aus. Eine schone Ideal.",5,-0.861,-0.5,-0.977
955,"Truly the best poem ever. 
 35 years ago when my kids were small, I read them a version published by the Parents' Magazine Press. I am pretty sure it was written and illustrated by Edward Lear, but I could be wrong about the illustrations. (Lear was originally a landscape painter before he wrote children's poems. I think he was somewhat like Beatrix Potter in that he started writing nonsense to please young relations; his large Victorian family had been split up when his parents died.) 
 ""The themes in this (rhyming) story of a young Pelican engaged to marry a Crane, with whom she will fly away to never again see her family is so poignant, and yet the words are so satisfying: 
 King and Queen of the Pelicans,We 
 No Other birds so grand we see 
 None like we have feet like fins 
 And lovely leathery throats and chins"" 
 I ask you , who could resist that? 
 ***UPDATE*** 
 I found the edition I read: 
 It is illustrated by HAROLD BERSON, published by Parents Magazine Press in 1967. If you can ever find a copy of this edition, the pictures are wonderful. Subtle yet funny. Elegant yet true to ornithology.

989,"Two years have passed since I last reviewed a kids' book (the kid in question here being my daughter). Her reading has gone up a notch in sophistication since the last one she called to my attention. This story concerns a sixth-grade girl in Vermont in the 1960s. Tessy seems content with her role as a C student but is less happy about the gulf that separates both her from the elite girls in her class and her uncouth parents from theirs. But she's a feisty kid who doesn't hesitate to notify classmates, when they need to be told, that they are boobs. This leads to amusing scenes: 
 Peggy stood in front of everybody, huffing and puffing and sputtering while Jack looked her up and down and said he'd always wanted to see a boob. 
 Tessy is the only kid in her class who did not want the plum assignment of doing the oral report on Ethan Allen, so naturally she gets it. Much of what follows consists of the report itself, which ends up being delivered in installments over a period of many days. I would not have thought of structuring a story in this way, and I'm a little surprised that it works. It's a story in which a C student becomes an A student -- not that her work is recognized by an incompetent and absolutely repulsive teacher -- and the in-crowd shows its true colors. Oh, and Tessy's embarrassing parents redeem themselves as well. (That part came as a relief to me, since I'd been wondering if my daughter had been trying to tell me something.)

996,"UPDATE: The feedback from the children and the parents of my elementary classes has been overwhelming, therefore we can safely say that this book has been officially approved and loved by the persons of interest, that is the children themselves:) 
 What a gloriously beautiful book! It reminds me of the ones we used to have when we were children, in a time that was much more innocent, less dangerous. When it was easy for the parents and the teachers to communicate the love for reading since there were no mobile phones, no bloody idiotic Facebook, no aEUR~aEUR(tm)teenaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) programmes that manipulated the children to behave as spoiled adults before their time. Back then, we didn't need fancy page material or gore and princesses painted to look like vampires. We needed books that were simple enough for a child to understand and with a message (as old-fashioned as it may sound) for the adult to convey. 
 aEUR~aEUR(tm)The Frightened Little Flower BudaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) deals with a crucial worry of ours, the fear of letting our children develop themselves freely, because we either want them to do exactly as we do or because we donaEUR(tm)t want them to be hurt or disappointed. The anxiety that comes when our child is a bit more introverted than weaEUR(tm)d want and as a teacher, IaEUR(tm)ve often seen this worry on many parentsaEUR(tm) eyes. With simple and beautiful texts, RenA(c)e shows that the bud takes its own risks no matter the circumstances and, many times, out of a negative, contradictory situation something positive occurs. The symbolism is poignant and couldnaEUR(tm)t be more relevant to our current times, when parents and teachers are plagued with all kinds of fears and uncertainties over our childrenaEUR(tm)s future. The illustrations inspired by the flaura and fauna of County Leitrim in Ireland are stunning. The post-reading activities are easy and useful for engaging the children, developing their thoughts on the subject and sharpening their observation skills. 
 As a teacher, I usually choose childrenaEUR(tm)s books to further familiarise my students with the main texts and try to develop their reading comprehension skills as much as possible. This is a book that can be used in class and become an exciting process for both teachers and students. It provides food for thought not only for our young ones, but for us adults as well, over the issues of restrictions, protection and coming to terms with the society of today. RenA(c)e Paule and G.R.Hewitt should be extremely proud of themselves. Many thanks to both for the opportunity to discover my classaEUR(tm) new favourite read.",5,-0.171,0.184,0.982
