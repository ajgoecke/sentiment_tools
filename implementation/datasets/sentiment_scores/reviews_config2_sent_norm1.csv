156,"inhaltlich geht es hier um ein madchen namens melody. sie lebt mit ihrer oma zusammen, die eine pension fuhrt. leider haben sie geldprobleme und ein schmieriger grossunternehmer will sie zwingen ihnen die pension zu verkaufen. als wenn das nicht schlimm genug ware,  macht auch die tochter dieses unternehmens melody  der schule ihr leben schwer. melody ist wirklich ein toller charakter fur kinder, um sich mit ihr zu identifizieren. allerdings hat sie keine ecken und kanten, aber fur ein kinderbuch ist das okay. sie hat nur einen besten freund, aber der ist dafur mehr wert als tausend andere. die beiden finden ein ei und aus dem schlupft ein greif. das wird super suss beschrieben und man merkt die bindung die melody und der greif eingehen. schnell wird klar, dass auch der greif  gefahr schwebt und nun mussen die drei zusammenhalten. 
 das ganze wird fur kinder recht spannend, aber doch eher gefuhlsbetont, beschrieben. allerdings ist es kein -age-buch. dafur wird alles zu leicht aufgelost und ist zu einfach strukturiert. allerdings wird auch nirgends behauptet es sein ein -age-buch und daher ist das vollig  ordnung. es gibt keine zu brutalen szenen, also vollig  ordnung fur ein kinderbuch. 
 das cover stellt eine szene aus dem buch dar und ist daher wirklich gut gewahlt. ich finde, dass sogar die tiefe verbindung zwischen melody und agravain darauf perfekt zur geltung kommt. helge vogt hat mich mit dieser zeichnung  beeindruckt, dass ich uberlege mir doch die gedruckten bucher der reihe zuzulegen. 
 der horbuchsprecher stefan kaminsky ist ja eh einer der besten und auch hier machte er seine arbeit wieder unglaublich gut. seine stimme passte perfekt. man konnte die einzelnen personen gut auseinander halten und emotionen wurden gut vermittelt. 
 etwas gestort hat mich, dass einige fragen total offen blieben, ohne das es sinn ergab. vielleicht lag es  der kurzung. also ich habe keinen direkten hinweis darauf gefunden, dass das buch fur die horbuchfassung gekurzt wurde, aber ich vermute es sehr stark.  wurde das verschwinden einer person uberhaupt nicht erklart,  ich sehr merkwurdig fand. 
 *fazit:* 
 4,6 von 5 sternen 
 dies ist ein wirklich tolles kinderbuch mit sympathischen charakteren. fur kinder ist die handlung sicher auch sehr spannend, aber vor allem konnen sie sich mit den charakteren identifizieren. das buch ist kein -age- buch, aber ein fantasyreiches kinderbuch.",0,-0.329,-0.429,-0.989

220,"cuando  entrado en goodreads para escribir un review de ""el increible caso de barnaby brocket""   encontrado, sorprendentemente, con muchisimas opiniones positivas del libro. 
 esta  es una de ellas. 
 en primer lugar  ha confundido la traduccion bastante ambigua del titulo original. ?por que suprimir la connotacion negativa? aun asi ninguno de los titulos  ha parecido acertado. 
 ""la de cosas aburridas y sin sentido alguno que le pasan  barnaby brocket"" seria un titulo mas adecuado. nunca  habia encontrado con un acercamiento mas vulgar al concepto de ""ser normal"" o ""ser diferente"" al resto de personas que el que ha intentando llevar  cabo aqui john boyne. 
 barnaby se comporta como un nino de 8 anos...  veces. otras veces . el autor nos explica, en ocasiones, que metodos utiliza barnaby para mantenerse pegado al suelo. en otras . 
 el argumento  es lo unico que falla en este libro: los dialogos, desprovistos de sentido y vacios, se hacen cansinos  la decima pagina. los personajes vienen, van y tu te preguntas una vez mas si en algun momento empezara  importante algo o alguien en esta historia. 
 considere mucha veces dejar este libro. incluso  empezado y acabado otros al tiempo que retomaba este, muy de vez en cuando, esperando que el final compensara todo el tiempo perdido. 
  ha sido asi. ""el increible caso de barnaby brocket"" es dolorosamente normal. insipido y aburrido. como los padres de barnaby y todos sus allegados.",1,0.4,-0.333,0.769

283,"si te gusta alicia en el pais de las maravillas,  leas esto. 
 existen dos adaptaciones muy famosas de este libro, las cuales son la version animada de disney y la version actuada de tim burton. 
 la pelicula animada nunca la  visto completa. nunca  ha convencido. 
 la version de tim burton ( pesar de ser de tim burton) tampoco  gusto. 
 si bien se sabe, en 9 de cada 10 casos el libro es mejor que la pelicula. este libro entra en el caso sobrante donde sucede lo contrario. 
 nunca tuve la intencion de leer alicia en el pais de las maravillas. la razon de mi lectura es que lo encontre en una tienda  un precio super economico y decidi darle una oportunidad. 
 este es un libro de 100 paginas el cual  tarde casi dos semanas en leer... !100 paginas! !en dos semanas! los capitulos eran de menos de 10 paginas y solamente podia soportar leer esta pequena dosis por dia. era demasiado para mi. 
 creo que lewis c. es un buen escritor, y la verdad es que la historia es muy peculiar y original. pero simplemente  mi   gusto. 
  encontraba sentido en la trama,  confundia al punto de irritarme y alicia se ha convertido en uno de los personajes que mas aborrecere en el mundo de la literatura. 
 este libro casi  causa un bloqueo de lector. considere en dejar este libro cuando ya llevaba mas o menos 20 paginas leidas. siendo honestos, la unica razon por la que lo termine es por su tamano. y es que es !super pequeno! un libro que, si hubiera disfrutado, lo hubiera leido en cuestion de una hora. definitivamente si este libro hubiera tenido unas 200 o 300 paginas lo hubiera abandonado.  lo habria soportado.

 tuukka-omarin isan puhe oli kuin vanhoista kirjoista, joissa sanottiin ""hyva herra"" ja ""tehkaa niin hyvin"" ja ""pikkuleipia oli juuri parahultaisesti"". tama taas johtui siita, etta tuukka-omarin isan omassa kielessa, arabiassa, asiat sanottiin silla tavoin hoystettyina. varsinkin tervehdykset ja kiitokset vahan kuin sokeroitiin.",3,0,-0.333,0

 se lamenta el sexismo, por cierto, sobre todo tratandose de una obra infantil, pero tampoco podia ser de otra manera; hay que tener en cuenta que es de 1964, y ambientada en una epoca aun bastante mas preterita. dejemos dicho que este aspecto es un testimonio de la cultura que la novela retrata.",3,0.4,0.333,0.34

934,"uno de los libros mas magicos y hermosos que poseo en mi biblioteca. por alguna razon, mientras lo leia en mi cabeza sonaba ""fairground"" de joby talbot (hagan la prueba, escuchen el tema, lean el libro y diganme si  se complementan  la perfeccion), entre otros temas similares. 
 de las ilustraciones  se exactamente que decirles sin quedarme corta,  quitan el aire,  arrebatan las palabras para expresar lo que siento al verlas. lacombe tiene una capacidad deslumbrante para darle vida y personalidad  sus criaturas con algunas pinceladas, sin mucha complejidad. cuando lo conoci pude ver en persona y comprobar que es ese tipo de artistas que viven exclusivamente para el arte, que es de lo mas talentoso y humilde que puede haber, sin duda un gran genio. 
 ""el herbario de las hadas"" es un libro que cumple varias funciones: es un herbario, es el intercambio de experiencias, conocimientos y tambien dolencias por medio de cartas, el encuentro de un hombre comun con un mundo de criaturas magicas y apasionantes. la historia que sebastien perez cuenta invita  amar  cada especimen que el protagonista va encontrando.  hay chance de que  te enamores de por lo menos uno de ellos, son todos sumamente adorables, con su caracter, su belleza y esencia, individualmente brindan sus pequenas cualidades que los distinguen de los otros. algunos mas risuenos y carismaticos, otros mas melancolicos y quiza tambien mas peligrosos y severos. pero como ya les  anticipado/remarcado anteriormente, todos tienen lo suyo y se hacen admirar facilmente. 
 el libro viene en formato tapa dura y es de gran tamano para que las ilustraciones se puedan apreciar apropiadamente. la estructura y el diseno del mismo son fascinantes, puesto que cuenta con paginas cuidadosamente caladas que ayudan  entrever pequenas criaturitas que esperan  que demos vuelta la pagina para descubrirlos y enamorarnos. cuenta tambien con paginas traslucidas que permiten ver un poco mas alla de lo que normalmente vemos en las hojas comunes. es cuestion de tenerlo entre manos un ratito para darse cuenta de que  es cualquier libro, sino que es verdaderamente un tesoro, de las obras mas pintorescas y atractivas que existen.",5,0.4,0,-0.869

 es geht um das moderne leben. ende macht kein neues argument: unserer welt fehlt spiritueller bedeutung. wir eilen uns immer. wir streben nach quantitat, nicht qualitat. wir pausen nie, und das leben flieht von uns. aber er ist eigentlich optimist, wie meng tzu oder rousseau, und er sieht  die geister der kinder die quelle unserer wiedergeburt. wir alle sind spontan. jede stunde unseres leben ist eine gelegenheit, die man nur verlieren kann, wenn er vergisst sie zu benutzen. momo ist eine genugsame heldin, die stark ist, weil sie zuhoren kann, und teilt ihre zeit aus. eine schone ideal.",5,-0.489,-0.5,-0.977
