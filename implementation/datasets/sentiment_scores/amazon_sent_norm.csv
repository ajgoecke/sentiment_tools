4,"  Be careful when you buy an item like this. It's important to buy the model that is designed for compact fluorescent bulbs. This particular model is designed for incandescent bulbs. As the sun hits the light sensor, it begins to flicker and  to dim and eventually turns off by mid-day. The sensor is essentially behaving like a dimmer. Sometimes light from the bulb itself will reflect into the light sensor and result in dimming of the bulb.\n\nChoose a different brand or model that is designed to be used with compact fluorescent lightbulbs. Because electricity through the sensor flows in an all or nothing fashion, the bulb will not appear to be dimmed. Like all of these automatic dawn to dusk controllers, any light that reflects into the sensor can still affect the function of the device; in my case it was causing intermittent blinking or random on/off behavior.\n\nMany factors affect the function of these devices. Sometimes it's the shape and color of the light fixture. Sometimes it's the length of the light bulb or intensity of the bulb. I also don't like the appearance of the lightbulb after it is lengthened by this device. My solution was to buy a different model/brand (from a big box store) designed for compact fluorescent bulbs. I wrote a review of a similar product and I find it works when I use short LED bulbs. Your mileage will vary.",1,0.278,-0.091,0.844

I was really excited to try this product on her carpeted floors. Finding the floor joists was no problem for us. We watched a few videos online and used the recommendation to start looking for the joists next to duct-work for our central air vents. We hit it on the first try and measured over 16 inches from the first joist to find the subsequent ones. We put the screws every 6 inches or so all along the joists, and did three joists in total. During the instal we had issues with some of the screws snapping off too early and had to use vice grips to get them out of the floor. After quite the project her floors still squeek just as badly as before. This product made absolutely no difference in the squeeking. I was really disapointed becuase it seems to get great reviews, it wasn't too difficult to do but it was time consuming. Now we will just have to wait until she gets conditioned to the sound of squeeky floors so it doesnt wake her up, and in the meantime we are learning a \path\ out of her room with minimal squeeks.

Turned it on and started cleaning up, and when time to turn it off the switch would not work! try and try and the thing would not turn off. So I unplugged it from the wall. The reason this is a big deal is when someone pays close to 100 dollars for a product it should last more than six months, and the other reason is when I plug it back in or unplug it there are sparks at least half inch long coming from the outlet. This not only will hurt someone, but will make the outlet in the house no good either. As far as care goes it is well maintained. Bag change and belt (which it doesn't need one because it never worked long enough). Is this worth 90 dollars, NO. If you take the top off to look at the motor and power switch its held together by cardboard. And the switch is cheap plastic so no wonder why it quit working. Checked to see if there is a replacement switch, and guess what, Eureka has discontinued the belts and Bags, and no power switch.  So to bring this to a end, the 20ft power cord is short, the bag beings to smell after while, all plastic, switch fails, all this thing has for it is power.

I didn't read the reviews before buying and was disappointed to find two major issues:\n\n1)The plastic clip covers are so slippery that I can't really use them without removing the covers completely.\n2)The gauge is so tiny that even the short length barely over 1 foot results in .8 ohms of resistance. Absolutely useless for anything that needs to carry any current (even 1 amp and your voltage is already 1.6 V less than is was at the source by the time you lose .8 V on each end). For resistance measurement they add a total of 1.6 ohms to the total measurement if used to connect something to the meter. They are only good for measuring voltage with the tiny measurement current that a meter uses for that. If you use them anywhere else in a circuit keep in mind that you just added a .8 ohm resistor whether you wanted one or not.\n\nConclusion: not worth the cheap price. Buy some clips without the wires and crimp / solder them to your own quality wire.",2,-0.111,0,0.126

The other problem is that there is no bag actually designed to reach the bottom of the vacuum, so that as the bag fills up, it ends up hanging on the inlet causing pressure on the paper and eventually ripping open blowing all the debris\\dust all over the place. Those disposable wrap around paper filters that go over the foam sleeve clog up way too fast. Another problem is that housing just below the motor that is supposed to hold the foam sleeve directly interferes with the inlet leaving no room even if there was a tall bag that could reach the bottom of the vacuum offering support as debris collects and not putting pressure on the bag opening.

628,"  The forte of this gas can is that it will be durable and reliable for years.  In my view, if you need to carry gas in your vehicle, this is the container to do it with because it is stronger than a plastic type can.  It is easy to work with.  The can should also be very good about fuel evaporation.  The ratio of height to width is also good so in the event of taking fuel home, a hard stop will less likely tip the can over.  This is the positive side.\n\nAs for the cons, I temper my comments because I don't know the extent of the regulations that they had to comply with when designing the can have reduced the convenience of use.  This should be considered with my first carp: filling the can.\n\nCARP #1:  The filling is via a spring-loaded opening opposite the fuel transfer hose, on the other side of the handle.  There is no catch to keep it open and this can be a problem when trying to transfer fuel from one container to another.  Of course when filling the can at the pump, the fuel nozzle will keep will prevent the opening from closing.  To solve the problem of adding fuel from another can, I am using a short length of pipe and a funnel to transfer the fuel.  This works very well.  There is a fuel screen that will prevent the pipe from falling into the can.\n\nCARP #2: If one looks closely at the end of the fuel hose, there's a brass fitting on the end and it is clamped on but very poorly so that the edges of the fitting bulge out and catch the lip of the fuel inlet hole making it difficult to remove the tube.  Following the advice of others who have this can, I filed off the rough edges and this helped but obviously, it shouldn't have been necessary.\n\nCARP #3: The hose is just too short.  To fully tip the can to completely empty it is is impossible on most cars because the cylindrical fitting to which the hose is attached comes in contact with the vehicle leading to potentially scratching the paint.  The first thing I did was to attach some insulation foam to the top of the fitting to prevent paint contact.  The second thing I've done is to purchase a No-Spill 206 Flexible Spout Extension (available here of course) that I attached to the end of the hose to give me the additional length necessary to fully tip the can.  It also provides additional safety when adding fuel to the car because in the event you are adding gas to fast to the tank, it will back up and the clear tubing will allow you to see this.  Also the fitting on the end of the hose forms a seal to prevent gas from spilling if the fuel does back up.  Others have noted that the flow rate for this can is not that fast so this situation may not arise.  On No-Spill cans, the flow rate is very high and so the fuel can back up frequently.\n\nA note to potential buyers: Be aware of metal's big disadvantage.  In the event you are adding fuel to the can that already has some fuel in it, you can't see how full it is so if you add too much fuel and it will spill all over in the event of transferring fuel from one can to another.  Hopefully when adding gas from a pump, it will shut off but I haven't test this..  In time, it will be possible for you to have a general idea of how much is in the tank.  Of course, if the tank is empty, you can use the fuel pump to tell you when the can is approaching full.  It is too bad there's no gauge on this tank but again, this may be a result of the safety regulations that govern the design of the tank.",4,-0.111,-0.029,0.643

668,"  This is a great can for storing gasoline.  It is heavy, and the spout makes it easy to pour gas into any type of gas powered appliance.  It does take a little getting used to, because of the way the safety handle is designed.  You have to pull on the metal \D\ handle, and have it open the vent in the back, before the gas will flow out of the tank.  This is not easy to do, because it is a fairly heavy duty spring that holds the cap shut.  It is also a little difficult to fill, because the spring loaded cap has to be pulled back, which is not easy, and the tank filled from the \back\ cap.  This is not intuitive.\n\nWe live in NJ, one of the only two states where it is the law for the gas pump attendant to fill your tank for you (Oregon is the only other state).  So during one of the winter storms, after we ran out of gas for our snow blower, I had to go to work and so asked my wife to fill up this gas can before I came back from work.  She took it to the gas station, and no one there could figure out how to open the can to fill it with gas so she had to come back empty handed!  So I had to go out after I got home, after there was already a foot of snow on the ground, in the dark to get gas, and then blow the snow!  So, I took one star off for the \non-intuitive\ way to fill the tank, and also for the difficult mechanism which takes a lot of force, to get gas to flow from this can.  It is much harder in the cold, while wearing gloves to pull back on the handle and open the vent and dispense the gasoline.\n\nDespite that, it is still a much better can than the plastic cans that I have had before.  It does not leak or vent into the garage, so there is no gas smell in the garage.  It is therefore a much safer way to store gas in the garage.  The one I got was also \Made in the USA\ which is a bonus.  I would still strongly recommend this can for anyone who needs to store gasoline for all their gas powered tools.",4,-0.026,-0.143,0.905

The steamer comes with an assortment of attachments, such as hard floor steam mop and various brushes.

Only one of the four front plate screws had a lockwasher, so maybe someone had opened the unit I received at some point.\n\nThe included parts list states that resistor values above 100K are only 1/2 watt. I was curious about this so I pulled the unit out of its case, and from what I can tell without opening the unit further there are actually two 1/2 watt resistors in parallel for the 100K values and above, which doesn't gibe with the parts list. (Not that it really matters - you'd need a voltage drop of ~220V to dissipate 1/2W from a 100K resistor, and I would be very leery of subjecting the switched in this unit to that much voltage.)\n\nAs others have stated, the case is fairly flimsy, especially the handle/stand.

This laptop still seems to have a lot of life in it so I ordered this product based upon INET reviews.  Fortunately my laptop was designed for easy fan/heatsink service with a separate cover allowing full access to the heatsink assembly w/o removal of any other parts/components.  (Kudos to Acer for that)  I removed the heatsink/heatpipe and cleaned the 2 relevant motherboard chips and corresponding heatsink surface pads with alcohol.  One chip had a thermal pad which I discarded in favor of this thermal grease.  The other chip had a dried out grease spot that I just cleaned away.  I used a shop vac in reverse to blow out the heatsink radiator fins and fan housing (immobilize the fan impeller if you do this). I applied a moderate film of this product to the two chip surfaces and two heatsink pads and re-installed the fan/heatsink.  Re-assembled, and so far, so good.  In 7 hrs of runtime, the fan still kicks on to moderate and high speeds, but my CPU temps have stayed below 58C vs 90C shutdown.

I wanted to be more proactive against them this time, so I bought this.\n\nWell, it made me feel a lot better to be battling back against them, that's for sure.  It sucks to feel helpless.  Like I said, I can't tell how well it was working on them, because I found the location of the infestation and got rid of it (the dust ruffle), and then the exterminator came in the next day.  Since then, things have been pretty quiet, but I've switched to using diatomaceous earth, which doesn't mix well with steam, y'know.\n\nBut I can tell you how well it works as a steamer.  First off, it holds 48 ounces, which will provide you with something like 45 minutes of continuous steam.  That's a lot.  It heats up pretty quickly, within about 6-8 minutes, so you're ready to go again quickly.  (I didn't listen to the warnings about letting it cool down for a while in between it running out and your using it again.  You can avoid this by opening the filling receptacle with oven mitts and standing back.  I've had no problems.)\n\nThere are a number of attachments, which is helpful.  I mainly used the one that looks like a mini-vacuum cleaner head - vaguely triangular, about 10 inches wide.  However, in using it, and using it, and using it (I was steaming for a couple of hours a night for several nights in a row), I broke it.  I opened it up to see if I could fix it (10 screws!) and I was able to, but it shouldn't have broken in the first place.  I guess that's what you get for $95.  It's a little bit plastic-y.\n\nBut, if you're not going to be using it like I was, meaning, if you're going to use it for cleaning up certain spots, say for 45 minutes or less at a time, I'd say that this was probably a pretty good steamer.  Worth the price.  I just wouldn't try to use it as if it were a professional model.",4,0.005,0.059,0.988

811,"  There are two issues with typical super glues. First, they are very thin and watery, so they are fine for repairing a broken piece of pottery or assembling anything else having well-mated surfaces with no gaps, but they don't work well on anything else. Second, if you use a lot of it, you'll find that the cost per ounce of most super glues is very high, because the usual bottles are just tiny fractions of an ounce.\n\nInsta-cure addresses both issues. It is a less-watery gel, so it does a much better job with slightly irregular surfaces. I often use it for quick assembly of wood parts, which would never work with normal super glues. And the 2oz bottle is really quite a lot of glue. I use it to put together complex models made from wood, plastic and metal, and to make fairly large repairs. And a bottle goes a long way.\n\nEven for jobs like furniture making, it can be very difficult to hold parts in perfect alignment long enough to add permanent fasteners like screws. Now I use Insta-cure for my initial assembly and can then add the permanent fasteners in just a few minutes without the parts shifting.\n\nNote that this product is part of a family of super glues having different liquid thickness and setting times.

I agree with some who say the photos don't match what they purchased.  As I write this review, the photo is exactly what I ordered, but when I look at the photo on the current link for the item I ordered, it is totally different.

This seems to be where the problem comes from.  MY MagLight is nearly 20 years old and this was a great fit.  Double check your bulb before you buy it.\n\nThe reason I purchased this bulb was two-fold: 1: My current set of batteries (4-D cells) were getting old and the light output was very dim compared to what new batteries would cost.  2: I also know from experience that some bulbs grow dim before they die.  Given that I was about spend $5 on batteries, and possibly another $5 on a new bulb, the additional $5 to test the LED bulb seemed like a decent option.\n\nThe difference in light output between the two was night and day!  (pun intended)  It's a more consistent light - the focus ring on the light doesn't do quite as much with this bulb, but the overall intensity on the focused spot is much more than before.

Having the vatiety allowed me to join wood in ways I did not realize I could. I did several \tests\ on different woods as well as real jobs and was pleased to find the joints set up fast and held tight. When stressed, the joints only came apart after considerable force, and pulled out wood fibers. I don't know how it stacks up against other similar adhesives, but this kit is a convenient effective way to rapidly join wood in different applications.",5,0.148,0.6,0.823

However the two little tubes always got very sticky and messy. Therefore your hands always get sticky when using it.\n\nON THE OTHER HAND, Bob Smith's 5-min epoxy comes in two 4.5 oz bottles. Your hands never get sticky or touch the glue. You simply squeeze out equal amounts from the two dry and clean bottles. After each use you wipe the application nozzles clean. Great stuff.
