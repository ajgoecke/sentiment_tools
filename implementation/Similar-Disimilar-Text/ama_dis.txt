"3"	"  doesnt fit all 4-6 cell maglites.  it says it fits all but it doesnt. many people have posted that it doesnt but yet they still sell it and don't seem to care or have an option in either a new led that fits or a retaining ring that fits the larger led. if it came with its own retaining ring it would work."

"9"	"  It works , but not as good as I though should."
"10"	"  Nice looking calipers.  Shipping was initially quoted at 3 months or so, but arrived in 2 weeks with other items.  I'm not sure what that was about.\n\nUnfortunately, they got stuck immediately out of packaging and within the first 10 seconds.  I couldn't close the jaws past 1/32\"
