"1"	"Not his best book! A bizzare book about a black fish whose entire school/family are eaten, he then roams the ocean and finds a new family and encourages them to survive in the open ocean by ganging together and pretending to be a bigger fish. Interesting and teaches a lesson but is not the best book to read."
"2"	"So am I the only one not impressed?"
"3"	"What young girl did not love the Baby-Sitters Club and Karen, the Baby-Sitters Little Sister?"
"4"	"Yay for more picture books featuring lgbt characters! Nay for the way women were portrayed in this particular book."
"5"	"Well, the kids liked it well enough when read aloud, but I wasn't really a fan. I didn't care for the illustrations, and the story was just meh. Not one I'm likely to use again."
"6"	"This kind of illustration doesn't typically appeal to me. I don't mind collage but people and faces seemed hastily drawn in a way that makes me think the illustrator doesn't have those technical skills. And yet, Collier is award-winning. There's no accounting for taste, as they say."
"7"	"The one star is from the childhood me - I didn't fancy this book at all as a kid. I think it scared me, and I also think that I didn't like the style of the writing or the drawings and I have a hunch I won't like it now either. Have no intention really to reread in now, and I think my childhood opinion is suitable enough for a children's book."
"8"	"Poorly written and not interesting."
"9"	"Ugh. 
 I read this a long time ago and did not like it."
"10"	"(SPOILERS) some thing in the book were comical. the outcome was kind of predictable but its possible that i was able to predict it because my brother wants to secret passages and rooms in his house."
