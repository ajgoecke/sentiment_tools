"89",89,"  The wood floors in the house we just moved to squeek badly. Getting out of my infants room at night after getting her down in her crib is a nightmare. I was really excited to try this product on her carpeted floors. Finding the floor joists was no problem for us. We watched a few videos online and used the recommendation to start looking for the joists next to duct-work for our central air vents. We hit it on the first try and measured over 16 inches from the first joist to find the subsequent ones. We put the screws every 6 inches or so all along the joists, and did three joists in total. During the instal we had issues with some of the screws snapping off too early and had to use vice grips to get them out of the floor. After quite the project her floors still squeek just as badly as before. This product made absolutely no difference in the squeeking. I was really disapointed becuase it seems to get great reviews, it wasn't too difficult to do but it was time consuming. Now we will just have to wait until she gets conditioned to the sound of squeeky floors so it doesnt wake her up, and in the meantime we are learning a \path\ out of her room with minimal squeeks.

"744",744,"  We have a couple of dogs. Small dogs. And we have hardwood floors. You can probably guess what I'm going to say.\n\nYep, the dogs are about as trained as a circus monkey at a beauty salon. That is to say...hardly. So the accidents are numerous. As I was concerned they'd damage our new hardwoods (about 2k sq ft of them) I put down Bona Polish. Now, I read all the negative reviews about Bona Polish but I figured it'd be better to have that get damaged than the wood floor.\n\nSure enough the dogs pee on the floor, we wipe it up, it leaves a cloudy patch. Not a \stain\ but more like a spot where the pee and the bona mixed to create a thin haze. You can't just wax over the spot either.\n\nSo I read a review that said to use the Bona stripper and this little guy. Incidentally my wife read that Windex will work in lieu of the stripper.\n\nI ordered and when it arrived we tried it out.\n\nAssembly was easy\nQuality is about what you'd expect from a $100 floor scrubber. It just feels cheap. (The only reason I'm marking down 1 star)\nInstructions? Thin. One page. Fortunately I've used floor cleaners before so I knew you just put the pads against the brushes...you don't remove the brushes and attach the pads.\n\nWe sprayed some Windex on a cloudy patch, waited a minute, then ran the scrubber over it and wiped up the liquid with a towel. A perfectly dull area was left behind but there was no sign of the spot.\n\nWe applied the Bona High gloss polish and had success! The spot was gone.\n\nWe hurriedly did the rest of the spots and other areas in the house where the Bona wasn't looking right and experienced equal success.\n\nSummary: if all you have is one or two small patches you can probably get by with just a green scrubby and Windex but the scrubber made short work of all that we had to do. I am currently planning on giving all my floors a quickly spritz and once over with the scrubber to help keep the Bona from building up. I figure about once every couple of years should be good.\n\nNote: when you run the scrubber new it puts off a decidedly \electrical equipment\ smell. I can't put my finger on it but it wasn't unpleasant. if you aren't expecting it you might be concerned. The unit didn't get hot or burst into flames so I'm going to assume the smell is normal.

Well, my teeth do get clean with this toothbrush, definitely. But I have complaints too.\n\nAs someone else remarked, messiness is an issue. Water and toothpaste and saliva drip down the toothbrush to my fingers unless I hold it at a downward-pointing angle at all times, which doesn't feel natural.\n\nAlso, a full recharge takes a *long* time, pretty much eight hours; and on days when my braces are making my teeth sensitive, this toothbrush feels almost like a dentist drill.

"786",786,"  I was Very Happy when I recieved my LED, I was Very Mad When I Took Apart my 4D Flashlight and tried to put this LED into it.. I put the LED Unit in and went to put the \Retaining Cap\ over the unit to Screw it Into the Flashlight, And The LED Unit Was Way Wider Than The Maglights Original Bulb.. The Retaining Caps Inner Circle was Not Wide Enough to Fit over The LED To Fasten It Down.\n\n  I Found one of My Knives and I Started to Slowly Shave Off Metal Flakes from the Inside Of the Retaining Cap Until It Was Wide Enough to Fit Over the New LED Unit, After Widening that Retaining Cap It Will Now Fit Over the New LED And It Will Still Work With the Original Bulb Unit..\n\n  So It Took A Little Bit Of Modification to Make It Work, But It Wasnt That Bad, And Now I Have An Awesome Maglight With A Very Bright Bulb.

Been collecting them over the years now and Fenix is all I buy theses days. So when I spotted this upgrade, I said to myself the ole mag light what a nice light for its time, and even better night stick! Haha, so what the hell lets breath new life into this old heavy beast!!

Idk,  It's got a nice throw beam which it's always had the nice spot, but it's a nice bright spot now, but thats it really, and that's not going to cut it for me to start carrying this beast again.

I don't understand how they couldn't make a brighter bulb as big as this light is. I mean come on there's plenty of room. All and all more run time, whiter light, cleaner spot. But No flood not even a little. Ive got to see what's going on around me. So 3 stars,  it's not much better then it was before really with light out put.

"370",370,"  This shop vac could be decent, unfortunately there is no appropriate bag designed for this vacuum. The problem is that any bag that actually fits this unit is designed for low-rise vacuums, not this tall type. The result is those wrap-around bags cant expand because the motor is in the center preventing any degree of expansion to retain debris. The other problem is that there is no bag actually designed to reach the bottom of the vacuum, so that as the bag fills up, it ends up hanging on the inlet causing pressure on the paper and eventually ripping open blowing all the debris\\dust all over the place. Those disposable wrap around paper filters that go over the foam sleeve clog up way too fast. Another problem is that housing just below the motor that is supposed to hold the foam sleeve directly interferes with the inlet leaving no room even if there was a tall bag that could reach the bottom of the vacuum offering support as debris collects and not putting pressure on the bag opening. Very poor design. To me, this was a waste of money.",2,-0.133,-0.429,-0.963,1.66

"617",617,"  TL;DR - Harness makes moving things easy, large enough to fit husky/large guys, only real con is lack of shoulder padding. Goes great with drinking while moving things.\n\nI live in a second floor in-law apartment (above the garage) and recently had the washing machine die.  From experience getting appliances/furniture into the apartment is a hassle (it's not that the stairs are narrow... it's that they are there) so I though we'd give these a shot. Delivery was prompt (have to love Prime) and use is super simple: Put harness on with buckle facing your front, thread strap under the middle of the load, cinch strap to the buckle, stand up. We did a test run with the old dryer (very light but large) and found it to be very easy; the hardest part was going down the stairs (the person on the bottom still controls most of the weight however the person at the top is helping take some of it as well as helping to balance) as the bottom person needs to have their strap cinched higher the the top person.  We then repeated the process with the washer (the heavy appliance) and found it's more an act of keeping the appliance balanced than anything! We were able to easily move the old appliances downstairs and into the truck as well as move the new stuff in under an hour with no break (okay, we found we could drink beer while moving the driers... sssh). The only real complaint we both had after all was said and done was that the straps need padding over the shoulder. The harness fits extremely well (we're both large guys; developed upper bodies with a few extra pounds so \large\ harnesses/shirts/etc never fit) and the buckle/strap combination is extremely easy to use.

These are not returnable/exchangeable with Amazon, so I contacted the vendor.  They asked that I send the can back, and sent me a replacement.  The replacement arrive damaged (the metal construction of the can is very thin, and the packaging is apparently not sufficient to protect the can without being double-boxed).  Eagle cheerfully sent me yet another can (also not double-boxed), which also arrived dented, but no so much so that I'm concerned about its safety.\n\nThe good:\n - made in USA\n - can pour faster than the Justrite can\n - stiffer, stronger feeling spout that can be quickly removed (compared to the Justrite)\n - good customer service from Eagle\n\nThe bad:\n - the pour valve is somewhat awkward to use, and as you pull on the handle to open it, the whole top of the can flexes quite a bit (disturbingly so) -- I find the design of the Justrite can to be much easier to use\n - the pour handle also awkwardly jams into the filler cap lever, which opens it slightly, which helps make the can pour more quickly and easily, but it seems like a bit of a kludge\n - the pour valve on one of my cans has become stiff to operate, making it harder to open, and causing the can to bend even more.  I am concerned that the seam where the valve attaches to the can may eventually leak, or snap off of the can altogether\n - the filler cap is made of sharp sheet metal that is uncomfortable to open and hold while filling the can\n\nIn summary, I also purchased Justrite Accuflow cans, and prefer them in almost every way.

"847",847,"  Arctic silver 5 as a thermal compound is one of the best thermal pastes for cooling a CPU, Ive used this specific thermal paste for two of my pc builds. Ive done some research and this performs slightly better than many other brands. It is important to note that the differences mentioned here are approximately a few degrees differences. Its notable to mention also that although its only a few degrees in improvement the price is barely noticeable and there's enough in this tube for probably 2 applications. A few simple steps to apply\n\n1. Remove the old thermal compound. You can do this by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.\n\n2. Apply a surface cleaner. You can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit. Make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.\n\n3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. Try not to apply so much that when you apply the heat sink it spills excessively to the side. If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip.  Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A card actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.\n\n4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly.

It's much more expensive than the regular duct tape, so I'd save it for cosmetic fixes. It's quite useful for small plastic trim pieces in older cars. Blends in pretty well and holds well.\n\nThe duct tape part, well, it claims to last 6x as long as traditional duct tape (the package says \based on accelerated aging tests\). I don't verify the factor of six, but the tape does seem to hold up pretty well.\n\nIf you need a roll of duct tape for cosmetic work, then this is your tool of choice.\n\nSingle rolls and short rolls (2104 in 3M part language) are also possibilities depending on the size of the project.",5,0.333,1,0.939,1.334

The height adjustments mechanism is fairly easy to use. I think the best application for these poles is for creating a medium term dust containment area. For long term areas, I prefer to build 2x4 walls, sealing the top and bottom plates with sill seal roll foam, and stapling poly sheeting to the studs. For short term, up and down in a day or less dust containment areas, I prefer the ease of use and light weight transportability of the Zip Wall Poles, but they are so darn easy to break.

The unit cannot even suck-up small chips of wood, I tried to suck-up one small pebble, 1/8\ in size at max. and it could not do it.

"778",778,"  I recently engaged in a nutrition and workout program with an aim a reducing body fat and gaining muscle.  The best way to know if you are making progress is by monitoring your body fat.  While there are many expensive methods for determining your body fat, utilization of calibers are the cheapest method with some level of accuracy.  The important part is to make sure you use them in a consistent fashion (location of the fold on the body, position of the caliper jaws on the skin, and time frame after releasing the jaws to take the reading) when measuring the skin fold.\n\nThe Slim Guide Skin Fold Calipers work as advertised and expected.  Just press the trigger which opens the jaws then place the calipers in position and release the trigger.  The spring will provide the appropriate force while you read the measurement.  Some measurements will require the use of another person (like triceps and back) to perform the measurements.  The small numbers can be hard to read if you are doing the measurement yourself.\n\nThe calipers are made of plastic but appear to be pretty durable (I dropped them a couple of times on the tile floor while taking measurements).\n\nOverall, and excellent product and does the job, just wish the numbers were a little bigger.",4,0.333,0.818,0.971,1.276

"543",543,"  After seeing delivery guys use similar straps to deliver refrigerators and other heavy items I decided to find these to help with a move I was doing.  In the end I only used them a couple times as I found it easier and quicker to just use brute strength than to climb in this and then strap up to the item.  The straps did help some when I used them, for example I used it to move an antique Philco fridge that is solid metal throughout.  While it allowed us to lift the fridge and it held the weight, the straps dug into our shoulders really bad and made it extremely uncomfortable to carry any distance.  The other drawback as stated by others, is climbing stairs.  Unless you go side by side, the weight will fall toward the lower person, and the difference in height causes the item to hit the stairs.  This was the main reason I ended up using two hands to move items instead of these.  If I had to run a race on flat ground while carrying a fridge with someone else, then these would be what I would use.  Seriously though, these really are limited to lifting heavy items without a place to grab onto and where using a dolly would potentially cause damage.

They work good for temporary installations and breadboarding, engineering, and for power supplies, and battery connections.

"377",377,"  I ran the Gloss Boss a couple of times on my hardwood floor and have had mixed results.\nPros:\nThe Gloss Boss works well for cleaning floors using the micro fiber pads as long as you use it as a substitute for a damp mop. I was surprised to see the Gloss Boss was able to clean the floors with only a fraction on the floor cleaner I normally would use with a mop .\nCons:\nThe Gloss Boss does not work well as a buffer or polisher. I used it for both on my hardwood floors and it simply did not have the weight/power to do the job. It could spread the wax on the floor, however it did a poor job of buffing out the floors.\nWithin twenty minutes of use, the \U\ bar on the handle bent and this disabled the unit to turn off without unplugging.\n The felt pads that came with the unit were flimsy and popped off the unit when in use.\n I could smell the unit overheat after about the first ten minutes- this makes me wonder how long it is going to last.\n Overall:\nIf you have small floor cleaning jobs using standard floor cleaners, it can do the job, at least for a while.

If the applicator is not attached properly, fluid will leak all over the place...hands, equipment, etc.  I will say that the applicator is difficult to attach properly.  I found that a fair amount of pressure is needed to properly seat the applicator's threads to the bottle's neck threads.  Once seated properly and then twist (screw) the applicator onto the bottle it's leak-proof.  It does take some practice to secure the applicator to the bottle...most people think that the applicator just doesn't fit because it takes effort to seat the threads.  Twist caps normally easily engage..this cap takes some effort and pushing. I do like the needle applicator ..it allows precise application to areas (rollers) which need to be cleaned.

I don't know if a different nail gun would hold two rows of nails or not. I am very pleased with this product.",4,-0.089,-0.2,-0.267,0.356

"145",145,"  I bought a set of these brushes from Amazon. I used all three within a short span of about 6 months because the brush head breaks off so easily. The OEM brushes and the ones I bought from reputable retailers never had this problem, just these replacement brushes from Amazon.com. As another reviewer had said, the brush head is constructed from inferior material and even shows signs of rust. I confirm his findings. I suspect someone is manufacturing bogus or knock-off of Braun Oral B brushes and selling them as OEM as I've never encounter such shoddy product from Braun before.\n\nDon't buy unless you can get a money-back guarantee that these brushes are not the inferior bogus knock-offs.",1,-0.24,-0.077,-0.096,0.326

"123",123,"  I believe that the quality of oral-b electronic toothbrush replacement heads has gone down.  I bought the 4 pack when my husband got down to his last one from the last set that I bought elsewhere.  So, when my hubby installed the first head, he started to use it and it broke, he tried a second one, same result.  The third one, so far is good.  I get the feeling that something was changed.  Unfortunately, we don't have another brawn/oral-b toothbrush to try the heads on.  We have an older model which was supposed to work with these heads and so far, it does work, as long as the head doesn't break down upon first use.\n\nI wish I hadn't purchased these in advance of my needs.  It would have been nice to discover the defect(s) when I still had time to return them.\n\nUpdate Summer of 2012: for some reason, our club store carries these also, and that's where we're going to get them while they last.  The failure rate is much less from the club packaging, I wish I know why others aren't as good.",1,0.133,0.2,0.24,0.214
